<head>PREFACE</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">Geography</hi>. In this book <hi rend="bold">man</hi> is the central thought. Every line of type, every picture, every map, has been prepared with a single purpose, namely, to present the <hi rend="italic">earth as the home of man</hi>, &mdash; to describe and locate the natural features, climates and products that largely determine his industries and commerce, as well as his civic and other relations, &mdash;thus bringing REASON to bear on the work.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Commerce</hi>. A geography that seeks to lay a broad basis for the study of nations must throw a strong searchlight upon their commercial relations. Commerce and the related industries take a leading place in this book, those of our own country being illustrated by many maps (<hi rend="italic">see pages 76-85</hi>), the originals of which were prepared expressly for this series of Geographies, by Mr. Henry Gannett, Chief Geographer of the United States.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Physical Features</hi>. The intelligent study of a country's resources must be based on its physical features and climate. For this reason the surface-forms and climate of the various parts of the world are fully treated in the text and pictures. Much care has also been given to the relief maps (<hi rend="italic">see pages 16 and 68-69</hi>).
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Illustrations</hi>. Nearly all the pictures in this book were engraved directly from photographs. To the selection and grouping of subjects for the photographs, the author has given full as much time and care as to the text itself. The aim has been to present <hi rend="italic">characteristic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">typical forms</hi> that are educative.
</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Topics</hi>. The work is presented in <hi rend="italic">topics</hi> in such order as will enable pupils to <hi rend="italic">reason from one step to another.</hi> Pupils should find out what the text tells about each topic and should be able to state the leading facts, not in the words of the book, but in their <hi rend="italic">own language</hi>. Teachers should question pupils upon topics.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Examinations should be based on topics broad enough to test thought. </hi></p>


<p><hi rend="bold">Helps</hi>. Many questions are placed under the HELPS at the end of lessons to guide <hi rend="italic">pupils</hi> in their study, by suggesting what parts of the text call for closest attention. The <hi rend="italic">topics</hi>, however, afford a broader basis for recitation.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Unity</hi>. This book holds the <hi rend="italic">earth as the unit</hi> before the mind and relates all study to that unit. <hi rend="italic">The memory is thus aided and much time is saved</hi>.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Sizes of Type</hi>. The text which needs the most careful study is in large type. The descriptive matter in small type does not call for close study, but many maybe used for supplementary reading. </p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Spelling and Capitalization</hi>. In spelling and usage of geographic names, the maps and text follow the ruling of <hi rend="italic">the United States board on Geographic Names</hi>.
</p>
<p>There has long been confusion in the usage of capital letters. This book adopts what seems to be the best modern usage and allows the capital in <hi rend="italic">specific names</hi>, such as Rhine and Andes, but not in <hi rend="italic">class names</hi>, such as river and plateau; thus <hi rend="italic">Rhine river</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">United States and Canadian Geographic Boards</hi> rule out the apostrophe from names of places within the two countries.

GEOGRAPHY	
</p>

<p>Geography is the study of the earth as the home of man.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-001-1" n="1"></note>

</p>


<p>We cannot visit all parts of the earth, such as the wide snow fields of the far north, where the Eskimos hunt the white bear and the seal for food; the great forests into which men go to cut down trees for lumber; the broad grassy plains where herdsmen tend cattle and sheep; the fertile fields white with cotton or blue with flax; the far-off lands where people feed silkworms on mulberry leaves and where the worms spin their soft homes of silken fiber; the deep holes in the earth where miners dig coal or iron ore out of the beds of rock.
</p>
<p>Nor can we visit all the great workshops

<note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-001-1" n="1">To TEACHERS:&mdash;The preface of this book should be read very carefully by every teacher, especially the topics referring to sizes of type, spelling, etc.
</note>

 and busy mills in large cities, where workmen carve and smooth the rough wood into beautiful furniture; or weave the fibers of cotton and silk into fine cloth; or melt the ore of the deep mines, change it to iron or steel and shape it into machinery and ships.
</p>
<p>We may perhaps visit some of these, but we can see pictures of many more. We can also study maps and find out where people have built their cities, &mdash;whether in cold lands or in warm lands, on mountains or on plains, near the ocean or far inland, in deserts or in lands through which flow wide and deep rivers.</p>

<p>We can read about the busy workshops, the rushing streams that turn mill wheels, the fields that supply fibers for swift looms, the high mountains that help to make rain and snow fall from the clouds, the wide and deep oceans that carry steamships loaded with freight from port to port, the swift trains that speed from city to city. We can also read about famous galleries of paintings and statues.</p>

<p>All this is geography, &mdash; the study of the earth as the home of man.</p>

<div type="section"><head> THE EARTH</head>
<p>1. Form and Size of the Earth
</p>
<p>The earth is a great ball of land and water, with air around it on all sides.
</p>
<p>The greater part of the land is rock, but a thin layer <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-002-a" place="middle left of the page"></figure>of the outside of the rock has crumbled into gravel, sand or finer soil.
</p>
<p>There is solid rock everywhere under the soil and under all the waters of the earth, but in most places layers of fine mud have settled on the rock under the water.</p>

<p>Most of the plants that yield us food grow in the layer of soil over the rock. In some places the bare rock comes to the surface.</p>

<p>Nearly all deep mines are in firm rock, and here are found most of the coal, iron ore, copper, gold and other minerals useful to man.</p>

<p>Very deep mines show us that the inside of the earth, far below the surface, must be very hot.<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-002-b" place="lower middle of the page"><figDesc>Rocks jutting out of the ocean</figDesc></figure>As such mines are dug deeper the heat increases.</p>

<p>It is believed that the earth was once much hotter than it is now, and that as it cooled it shrank away faster in some places than in others and thus made wrinkles like those on a withered apple. The higher wrinkles of the earth are now the land. Wide hollows between the wrinkles are filled with the salt water of the sea.</p>

<p>The surface of the land is not smooth, but has wide hollows or valleys in which
the waters of the sea collect. Nearly three fourths of the surface of the earth are covered with water that lies in these broad valleys. The dry land consists of the higher parts that rise above the level of the water in the great valleys.</p>

<p>The little maps on this page show the two sides of the round earth. The dark rough parts are the land; the other parts are water. The maps do not show the lands that lie under the water.</p>
<p>We live on the land, but the great bodies of water also are very useful to man. They supply the water for rain, and they carry ships loaded with goods from seaport to seaport.
</p>
<p>We see so small a part of the earth at a time that it does not look round, but there are many proofs that it has this form.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the proofs:</p>
<p>
1. Many persons have gone round the earth.</p>

<p>2. The smoke of steamers at sea can be seen long before the hulls come in sight above the sky line, or <hi rend="italic">horizon</hi>.</p>

<p>3. When travelers go day after day towards the north or the south new stars rise over the horizon before them, while the stars behind sink slowly out of sight.</p>

<p>4. Sometimes the earth moves between the sun and the moon and casts a shadow on the moon. The edge of this shadow always looks like part of a circle.</p>

<p>The sun and the moon are round, like the earth. The moon is smaller than the earth, but the sun is many times larger. The sun lights and warms the earth. The sun also lights the bright face of the moon, and the moon reflects some of the light to the earth.
</p>

<p>The great round earth curves a little less on two opposite sides
than on the other parts. Sometime perhaps you will learn how
this slight change of form holds the earth in one position, as it
turns round day after day, and thus enables us to see the sun,
the moon and the stars in the same place in the sky each year.</p>

<p>The earth is one of many bodies, called <hi rend="italic">planets</hi>, that move round the sun. The earth goes round the sun once a year.</p>

<p>The shadow of the earth on the moon is called an <hi rend="italic">eclipse of the moon</hi>. Sometimes the moon moves between the earth and the sun and causes an <hi rend="italic">eclipse of the sun</hi>, &mdash; that is, the moon shuts off a part or the whole of the sun from our sight.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">diameter</hi> of the earth, or the distance from side to side through the center, is nearly 8000 miles. The <hi rend="italic">circumference</hi>, or greatest distance round the earth, is about 25,000 miles.
</p>
<p>How many days would it take a train of cars, going at the rate of fifty miles an hour, to travel 25,000 miles? The earth is a very large home for man.</p>

<pb n="3" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-003" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
<p>No one knows just how high the layer of air that surrounds the earth reaches, but there are proofs that it is over 500 miles above our heads. The high air is very thin, or <hi rend="italic">rare</hi>, and at a very few miles from the surface of the earth we could not get air enough to breathe. The air near the earth is more <hi rend="italic">dense</hi>, as it is pressed down by the weight of all the air above it.

<p><hi rend="bold">2. Directions on the Earth</hi></p>

<p>The earth is always turning round like a spinning top, but the earth turns only once in twenty-four hours, or a day and a night. This spinning motion is called the <hi rend="italic">rotation</hi> of the earth.</p>

<p>The sun lights and warms one half of the earth at a time.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-003-1" n="1"></note>
 As the earth <hi rend="italic">rotates</hi>, some parts of it are turning
into the sunlight while other parts are turning away from it into the dark. One side of the earth thus has day while the other side has night.
</p>
<p>Bright daylight would be very tiresome if it lasted all the time,
with no dark hours for rest and sleep. Endless night would be cold <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-003-c" place="lower left of the page"><figDesc>Map C</figDesc></figure>
and dismal, with no sunshine to light and warm the earth.</p>
<p>
Far away in the north there is a point on the earth, known as the <hi rend="italic">north pole</hi>. It is
nearly under the north star, which is often called the <hi rend="italic">pole star</hi>. Opposite the north pole, on the other side of the earth, there is a point called the <hi rend="italic">south pole</hi>.</p>

<p>The word "pole" means <hi rend="italic">pivot</hi>, or point on which anything turns. The earth does not rest on anything, but turns in space <hi rend="italic">as if</hi> held  by a line running through it from pole to pole. We can think of such a line and call it the <hi rend="italic">axis</hi> of the earth. The poles are the ends of the axis.</p>

<note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-003-1" n="1"> To TEACHERS:&mdash; Strictly speaking, the light refracts and reflects slightly beyond the half of the earth, but this need not be taken into account in leading pupils towards the study of the zones of light and heat.</note>

<p>No person has yet reached the poles, though many brave men have tried. The poles are in regions where ice and snow last all the year.</p>

<p>North is the direction towards the north pole; south, towards the south pole. All lines that we may imagine running north on the earth meet at the north pole. All lines running south meet at the south pole.</p>

<p>East-and-west lines go round the earth in circles. The largest of these circles is midway between the poles and is called the <hi rend="italic">equator</hi>, because it divides the earth into two <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> parts. All east-and-west lines run parallel with the equator. When we face the north, east is along the lines to the right, and west to the left.</p>

<p>In most maps north is at the top and east to the right, but this is not true of all maps. If we remember that <hi rend="italic">north and south are the directions towards the poles</hi>, while <hi rend="italic">east and west are<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-003-d" place="lower right of the page"><figDesc>Northern and southern hemispheres</figDesc></figure>
 parallel with the equator</hi>, it will be easy to tell directions on all maps in this book.
</p>
<p>How many arrows on map A point north? How many point south? Which arrows point north on map B? On map C?</p>

<p>Which arrows are flying south on map B? On map C?
</p>
<p>How many arrows on map A point east? Which fly east on map B? On map C? Which arrows point west on map A? On map B? On map C?
</p>
<p>Of course there are no real circles or lines to be seen running round the earth, but we can imagine such lines and name or number them. We shall find that these lines are very useful in helping to locate places on the globe, just as




<pb n="4" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-004" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
we locate houses in towns or cities, by naming streets and cross streets.</p>
<p>The equator is far south of us. If we were near it we could see the sun overhead, or nearly so, at noon every clear day. The lowlands near the equator have no winter; hot or warm weather lasts all the year. Snow and ice are not
found in that part of the world, except on very high mountains.
</p>
<p>Dense forests cover much of the land near the equator. Birds, insects and large animals abound. Most of the insects have bright colors, and many of the birds have beautiful plumage.</p>

<p>The earth rotates from west to east. That is why the sun seems to rise in the east,&mdash;the earth turns us towards the east.</p>

<p>The earth is a <hi rend="italic">globe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sphere</hi>. One half the earth is a <hi rend="italic">hemisphere (hemi</hi> means <hi rend="italic">half</hi>). The equator divides the
earth into a <hi rend="italic">northern hemisphere</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">southern hemisphere</hi>.
</p>
<p>One of the little maps of hemispheres on this page shows the half of the earth having the most water; the other shows the half having the most land. In these maps north is not at the top, but is at the point where the north lines meet. South is at the point where the south lines meet.</p>

<p>How many lines on the map of the <hi rend="italic">land hemisphere</hi> are drawn north and south? Which pole is not shown on this map? Why not?
</p>

<p>By means of the sun or the stars, as well as by the mariner's compass, sailors can tell the direction in which they are going. Often the sun and stars are not in sight, and sailors have learned to depend mostly on the compass. Without this simple guide the task of steering vessels from port to port would be very difficult.
</p>

<p>Here is a picture of the mariner's compass. Under its glass cover is a round card, naming the<hi rend="italic"> points of the compass</hi>, &mdash; north,
south, east, west, northeast, etc. On the underside of the card is a steel magnet, in the form of a thick needle or bar, that swings on a pivot. The earth attracts this needle and makes it point almost north and south. In some places it points exactly north and south. <note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-004-1" n="1"></note>

FORMS OF LAND AND WATER</head>

<p>3. The Land and its Soil
</p>
<p>As rocks change from cold to warm or from wet to dry, they slowly crumble or decay, just as nails and wood do. but many years may be needed to loosen only a few grains. Water freezing in cracks in rocks often splits them, just as freezing water bursts bottles or iron pipes.</p>

<p>Rolling stones in streams often <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-004-c" place="lower middle of the page"><figDesc>Cliff showing how soil is formed</figDesc></figure>
strike together and knock off small pieces. The larger rolling rocks also pound upon and help to crush the smaller ones.</p>

<p>When rock has been ground to sand the little grains may blow about, strike together and crumble still finer.</p>

<p>Plants help to crumble the rocks. The hairlike roots creep down into tiny cracks in the rock, searching for food. As the roots grow larger they pry open the cracks and thus help to break the rocks.</p>

<p>Since the firm rock wears or wastes away to form large boulders, little pebbles, fine sand and dust, we may call all these <hi rend="italic">rock waste</hi>. When fine enough to support plants it is called <hi rend="italic">soil</hi>.
</p>
<p>The decay of rocks is slowly going on over all parts of the earth's surface where air and rain can reach them. In lands having much rain and frost, and also very hot and cold spells of weather, the rocks crumble more quickly.</p>

<p>Finely crumbled rock waste, mixed with decaying plant and animal matter, forms <hi rend="italic">topsoil</hi>. This is also known by the simpler name of <hi rend="italic">soil</hi>. The roots of most plants grow in the rich soil or topsoil.</p>

<p>Plants take up water and other kinds of food from the soil. If you will burn a piece

<note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-004-1" n="1">To TEACHERS:&mdash;The needle does not point to the north pole, but to the magnetic pole, a spot now near the shore of the Arctic ocean, about latitude 70&deg; N., longitude 96&deg; W. <hi rend="italic">See map on page 65</hi>.<lb />

Pupils should know how to find the points of the compass by midday shadows or by the north star. Doubtless this has been taught in the lower classes; if not, a brief oral lesson will suffice.

<pb n="5" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-005" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
of wood, the ashes will show you part of the food which the roots have taken up from the soil. When soil consists largely of good food for plants it is said to be rich or <hi rend="italic">fertile</hi>.</p>
<p>Each kind of rock makes soil different from that of other rocks; but each kind forms the best food for certain plants. Farmers try to find out what plants will grow best in the soil of their farms.</p>

<p>Most plants give back part of the food which they take from the soil. For example, many trees shed their leaves, and perhaps at last the trunks die and decay and mix with the soil. Countless grasses and o weeds die in the fields. When grass and grain are cut the roots and stubble are left to die and help to enrich the soil, &mdash; often being plowed in by the farmers. If the soil were robbed of all this food, it would sooner or later yield only very poor crops.</p>

<p>Thus, year after year plants grow and decay, while myriads of insects and worms live and die in the fine rock waste. The remains of the plants, the insects,<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-005-a" place="middle left of the page"><figDesc>A stream in dry weather</figDesc></figure> the worms and other creatures mingle with the fine rock waste to form the rich topsoil, or fertile soil.</p>

<p>The soil has not the same depth everywhere. In some places there are more rains, more frost, more sunshine, more plants, than in others, to help form the soil. Some kinds of rocks decay more quickly than others.</p>


<p>Running water washes soil down the slopes. It takes it from steep slopes, where the water runs swiftly, and leaves it on the gentler slopes or the level land, over which it flows slowly.</p>

<p>On steep hillsides much of the rainfall is shed quickly into streams, washing away some of the surface soil. The streams are thus filled with rapid currents of muddy water, and as they reach the valleys they often overflow their banks and spread the soil on the more level land.</p>

<p>On flat lands a large part of the rain sinks into the ground, instead of running away. If the soil is loose and sandy, almost all the rainfall sinks into it.</p>
<p>
When the rain ceases and the sky clears some of the water which is then left on the ground rises in the form of vapor. The drying of the ground is quickened by winds and sunshine. Water that changes to vapor is said to <hi rend="italic">evaporate</hi>. Rain water that stands till it evaporates does not help in washing soil down the slopes. The water that sinks into the ground does but little of that work. The rain water that runs off the surface washes away the greatest amount of soil.</p>

<p>On flat lands or gentle slopes the soil washes away very slowly and has time to crumble very fine to a great depth. There the rocks may decay for many feet below the surface, thus making plenty of soil for the roots of plants. In order to reach the firm rock, the soil must be dug away very deep, down to the place where the rain and frosts and heat cannot reach so freely.</p>


<p>The topsoil in valleys consists largely of fine waste that has washed from the higher land. Most of the water that sinks into the soil of hillsides also creeps down into the valleys and helps to keep the soil moist. For these reasons many of the best farms are in valleys or on level lands.</p>

<p>4. Rainfall and Springs</p>

<p>When moist air is cooled enough the moisture in it forms clouds that give out rain or snow. Part of the rain or melted snow soaks into the ground and is called <hi rend="italic">ground water</hi>.</p>

<p>Ground water creeping slowly through the soil and loose rocks may travel many miles towards the lower land. It is this water that makes the soil of meadows wetter than that of hillsides.</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-005-c" place="lower left of the page"><figDesc>River flooded by rains and melting snows</figDesc></figure>

<p>In some dry countries pipe wells are driven or sunk to reach a supply of ground water. These wells may be driven through layers of rock, beneath which the water is creeping. In some places the layers of rock cause the water beneath to flow long distances and then let it come to the surface.</p>

<pb n="6" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-006" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
<p>Water coming from the ground through a crevice <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-006-a" place="upper middle of the page"><figDesc>A geyser in action</figDesc></figure>forms a <hi rend="italic">spring</hi>.
</p>
<p>Many springs are found at the base of hills. Others appear along the banks of brooks or rivers. In many places the ground water rises in the beds of streams or lakes.</p>

<p>Surface water is often muddy, but nearly all ground water is clear, because it moves too slowly to carry even the finest rock waste. Spring water is therefore much better than surface water for drinking. Wells also are supplied by ground water.</p>
<p>
Most springs flow so slowly that the supply of ground water from one rain lasts till rain again falls. Such springs flow in both rainy and fair weather. In long dry spells, or <hi rend="italic">drouths</hi>, springs yield less and less water, or they may even cease to flow. The streams then become very low, or perhaps dry up. During long periods of dry weather trees may be kept alive by ground water which reaches their roots deep in the soil.</p>

<p>When soil is frozen, water cannot sink into it. In lands that have long freezing seasons plentiful rains are needed in autumn to give a good flow of water before the severe frosts harden the soil.</p>

<p>In winter, when the ground is frozen,the rain water and melting snow run quickly to the streams and often flood them. They then cut away their banks and wash the soil down their valleys, spreading it over the flooded lands or even carrying it to the sea. The flooded streams often carry down large blocks of ice and trunks of trees. These do much damage in breaking down bridges and clogging the beds of the streams.</p>

<p>In some parts of the earth the ground water flows over or through beds of hot rock deeply buried. The water becomes very hot, and as it comes flowing towards the surface steam forms and blows columns of the hot water high into the air, forming <hi rend="italic">geysers</hi>. If the hot water does not spout, but simply flows out in the form of a spring, it is called a <hi rend="italic">hot spring</hi>. There are many geysers and hot springs in the western part of our country.</p>

<p>
5. Lakes and Rivers</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Lakes</hi> are bodies of water having land on all sides, except where streams flow into or out of them. <hi rend="italic">Ponds</hi> are like small lakes.</p>

<p>Lakes are formed when streams flow into wide hollows in the land. If there is enough water to overflow the hollows, the streams will flow on. A stream flowing into the <hi rend="italic">head</hi>, or upper part, of a lake is called an inlet; one flowing out at the <hi rend="italic">foot</hi>, or lower part, is an <hi rend="italic">outlet</hi>.
</p>
<p>Some lakes are so large that thousands of ships sail on them from city to city, carrying freight and passengers.
</p>
<p>In lesson 7 we shall learn some of the ways in which lakes have been formed. One of the pictures on this page shows a queer bank of branches built by little fur
bearing animals called <hi rend="italic">beavers</hi>. This bank was built. 
across a valley in which a brook flowed. The beavers wanted a pond in which to make their huts. Can you find out why they build in or near water?</p>

<p>There is salt in nearly all the soil on the earth, but in most places there is very little. Water creeping through the soil takes up some of the salt and carries it to the streams. Generally, there is not enough to taste in the water; but after a stream has been flowing for a long time into a lake that has no outlet, it may carry in enough salt to make a <hi rend="italic">salt lake</hi>. If there is an outlet to carry off about as much water as enters the lake, the water is kept fresh.</p>

<p>In places where there is not enough rainfall to make the hollows in the land
overflow, salt lakes are common. If such lakes then dry away. the hollows may be left coated with the salt.</p>

<p>Large streams of fresh water flowing over the land are called <hi rend="italic">rivers</hi>. Small streams are <hi rend="italic">brooks</hi><note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-006-1" n="1"></note><figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-006-b" place="lower right of the page"><figDesc>A dam built by beavers across a valley in which a brook flowed</figDesc></figure>
.</p>

<p>Some rivers start from springs; others flow from lakes, swamps or melting ice and snow. The beginning of a river is called its <hi rend="italic">head</hi> or <hi rend="italic">source</hi>.
</p>
<note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-006-1" n="1"> In some parts of the United States small brooks are called <hi rend="italic">branches</hi>, and large brooks <hi rend="italic">creeks</hi>.</note>
<pb n="7" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-007" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
<p>The long trough in which a river flows is its <hi rend="italic">bed</hi>. Some parts of river beds are so steep that the water rushes swiftly along, forming <hi rend="italic">rapids</hi>. If the water tumbles over a cliff, it forms a <hi rend="italic">waterfall</hi>.</p>

<p>A small fall is a <hi rend="italic">cascade</hi>; a large <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-007-a" place="upper middle of the page"><figDesc>A steamer running downstream in rapids.</figDesc></figure>one is a <hi rend="italic">cataract</hi>. On page 94 there is a picture of Niagara falls, the grandest fall of water known in the world. We shall read more about this cataract later.</p>

<p>Many cities are built near the banks of rivers. <hi rend="italic">See picture, page 8</hi>. If the water flows swiftly, in rapids or falls, it may be used to turn mill wheels. If the rivers are deep, steamers and other vessels may go up and down with freight for the people that live along the banks.</p>

<p>The water in a river is the surplus rainfall that the ground and the plants do not use. It runs down the sloping land and may enter a lake or the sea. The lower<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-007-b" place="lower left of the page"><figDesc>A chain of lakes</figDesc></figure> end of a river, where it flows into the sea or into some other body of water, is the <hi rend="italic">mouth</hi> of the river.</p>
<p>
The lower parts of most large rivers on gentle slopes are slow and deep. Ships can enter the mouths of many of them and carry freight far inland. Some of the largest
cities in the world are built near the mouths of rivers. These cities carry on trade with one another across the sea and also collect and distribute goods for the people living along the rivers or far inland.</p>

<p>The deep parts of rivers, where steamers or other vessels may go from place to place, are said to be <hi rend="italic">navigable</hi>. Some rivers are navigable for many hundred miles<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-007-c" place="lower middle of the page"><figDesc>(A) River systems and river basins</figDesc></figure> from the sea.	
 </p>

<p>A river and all its branches form a <hi rend="italic">river system</hi>. The largest or longest stream in the system is called the <hi rend="italic">main</hi> river, and generally gives its name to the entire system.</p>

<p>How many river systems are shown in the picture marked (A) on this page? </p>
<p>Some of the longest rivers of the earth are three or four thousand miles in length, from source to mouth. On their way to the sea they receive many <hi rend="italic">branch</hi> streams, called <hi rend="italic">tributaries</hi>. Such rivers grow larger as they flow onward.</p>

<p>All the land which sheds water into a single river system forms a <hi rend="italic">river basin</hi>. The basin generally takes the same name as the main river of the system. A river system drains all the land which forms its basin.</p>

<p>How many river basins are shown in picture (A) on this page? Find the line which bounds the basin marked C. This line runs along the top of the ridges and separates the slopes of the basin C from those of the basins which adjoin it.
</p>
<p>The line which divides one river basin from another is called a <hi rend="italic">divide</hi> or <hi rend="italic">water parting</hi>. It is the line which parts the raindrops from one another, turning them into different basins.</p>

<p>Divides may be on high land or on low land. Some of the most important divides on the earth cross wide plains whose slopes are too gentle for the eye to detect.</p>

<p>6. Plains.<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-008-a" place="upper left of the page"><figDesc>City on a flood plain</figDesc></figure></p>

<p>After heavy rains, or after much snow has quickly melted, rivers may overflow their banks and spread over flat meadows. Flooded rivers are very muddy, for they not only cut their own banks, but their swollen branches also bring them muddy water.</p>

<p>As the water spreads over the meadows it moves more slowly than in its narrower channel, <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-008-b" place="upper middle of the page"><figDesc>Delta in a river mouth<lb /> (looking downstream)</figDesc></figure>and some of the mud settles on the meadows. When the flood is over,
this mud, or <hi rend="italic">silt</hi>,supplies fresh food to plants.</p>

<p>Meadow lands that receive soil from swollen streams are called <hi rend="italic">flood plains</hi>. In broad valleys the flood plains may be several miles wide.</p>
<p>
Many cities are built on flood plains, not
only because they are so fertile, but also to be near the rivers. Banks or walls are built <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-008-c" place="middle right of the page"><figDesc>Pines growing on a sandy coastal plain</figDesc></figure>to prevent floods, but the rivers may overflow the banks and rise into the streets of the cities, doing much damage. In dry countries,these plains are the best place for people to settle, as the water can easily be led in canals and ditches to the farms.</p>

<p>A large part of the fine mud in rivers is carried down to the sea. Much of it may settle near the river mouths, where the water flows slowly into the sea. The <hi rend="italic">sediment</hi> forms low and flat plains in which the rivers may divide into branches, as shown by one of the pictures on this page.</p>

<p>Plains built of sediment at the mouths of streams are called <hi rend="italic">deltas</hi>. Many deltas are the lower ends of the meadows or flood plains built <figure entity="ent17540901-c-008-d" place="lower middle of the page"><figDesc>A lake once stood where these cattle are grazing</figDesc></figure>out into the sea. The soil of delta plains is generally fine and fertile. Most deltas consist in part of many low islands.<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-008-e" place="lower left of the page"><figDesc>A lake once covered the bottom of this valley. The stream cut down the rim and drained the lake</figDesc></figure>
</p>
<p>Not all rivers make deltas. Strong currents in the sea may carry away the mud as fast as the rivers bring it down. Some of the largest cities are on deltas. They carry on trade between the rich delta lands and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>
Many parts of the land were once under the shallow water of the ocean border. They were slowly raised from beneath the sea and became dry land. We do not know what caused them to rise.</p>

<p>The sea-bottom near most shores is slowly made smooth by layers of sediment washed from the land. When evenly uplifted the smooth bottoms form plains having very gentle slopes. In the soil of some of these plains are found myriads of shells that belong in the ocean, and that have not yet had time to fade and  lose their beautiful colors since the seabottom came up to form dry land; but most of these plains are very old.
</p>
<p>A plain that was once part of the sea-bottom and that is now near the coast is called a <hi rend="italic">coastal plain</hi>.
</p>
<p>The coastal plain shown in the middle picture on this page is part of a great plain in our own country. It covers many thousand square miles. If the land shown in the smaller of the two pictures near the bottom of page 12 were to rise, the sea-bottom might form a coastal plain like the one in the picture beside it.</p>

<p>Rivers flowing into a lake may carry much muddy water. The fine mud settles on the bottom and makes it more and more level. If in time the water of the lake is drained away, the smooth bottom becomes a dry plain. Some of the most fertile plains in the world were formed in this way.</p>

<pb n="9" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-009" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
<p>A plain that was once the bottom of a lake is called a <hi rend="italic">lake plain</hi>.
</p>

<p>One of the pictures on page 8 shows a small lake plain, with a stream winding across it. Some lake plains cover thousands of square miles. Their soil is very fine and fertile. The cattle, shown, in one of the pictures on page 8, are grazing on a very fertile lake plain in our own country.
</p>
<p>Plains that stand high above sea level are called <hi rend="italic">plateaus</hi>. Most of the rocky layers in plateaus were made very long ago beneath the sea. Streams wear deep valleys in high plateaus.</p>

<p>7. Mountains and Valleys</p>


<p>A rugged part of the earth's surface, rising high above the surrounding country, is a <hi rend="italic">mountain</hi>. A <hi rend="italic">hill</hi> is like a mountain in form, but generally not so high.</p>

<p>A low place or hollow in the land may be called a <hi rend="italic">valley</hi>.</p>

<p>In some places plains made of rock have been cracked and broken into long wide blocks, looking somewhat like broken blocks of ice in a pond or stream; but the blocks of rock have been tilted up in the form of high ridges, as shown in picture (A) on this page. Such ridges are one kind of mountain. You can see by the picture that these mountains were not made long enough ago for the rain to cut deep valleys in the cliffs. After a long time the <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-009-b" place="lower part of the page"><figDesc>(A)Mountain formed of blocks of rock broken and tilted up           (B)Blocks formed like those in the cut at the left, but now deeply worn by streams making valleys across them</figDesc></figure><figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-009-c" place="upper right of the page"><figDesc>Deep valleys cut in a plateau</figDesc></figure>rain and streams may wear many side valleys in the bluffs, cutting them into rows of parallel ridges, as shown in picture (B).</p>

<p>The low places between the ridges are valleys. In some of these valleys there are streams and lakes.</p>

<p>Some mountains are made of layers of rock that have been bent arches, as shown in the middle picture on this page. mountains in the eastern part of our country were
formed in this way, but the forms of nearly all of them have been greatly changed by running water. Layers of rock rich in iron ore and coal are found in these folds and are a source of wealth to the people who own the mines.</p>

<p>The hollows or troughs between such folds are valleys. Sometimes the folds rise very slowly across the path of rivers and thus hold back the water, making lakes.</p>
<p>
In many parts of the earth
great masses of land have been
slowly lifted up far above the
level of the sea. During long
ages the rocks have crumbled
and the streams have cut deep
valleys in the surface (<hi rend="italic">see picture
at top of this page</hi>), just as you have seen the tiny streams cut into
soft ground, making valleys with ridges between them. After
working a long time, the rain, rivers and ice on very high lands
may carve great ridges and peaks called <hi rend="italic">mountains</hi>, some looking
like those in the picture at the top of page 10. Most mountains
are formed in this way, by the wearing of deep valleys in highlands.</p>

 

  
<pb n="10" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-010" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
<p>While lands are being slowly uplifted <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-010-a" place="upper half of the page"><figDesc>A hill of gravel rounded by ice</figDesc></figure>to form highlands, the rocks may break and slip, making the earth tremble for many miles around. The trembling is an <hi rend="italic">earthquake</hi>.</p>

<p>There were probably many earthquakes when the blocks of rock shown in picture (A) on page 9 were broken and pushed up. Another cause of earthquakes is given in the next lesson.</p>

<p>A high and<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-010-b" place="lower right of the page"><figDesc>This glacier has brought down gravel and blocked a valley with it, causing a lake to form</figDesc></figure> rugged ridge, or several such ridges near one another, may be called a <hi rend="italic">mountain range</hi>. Some ranges are thousands of miles long.</p>

<p>A number of ranges having the same general direction in one great highland form a 
<hi rend="italic">mountain system</hi>.</p>

<p>There are many long ranges of mountains in the
western part of our country, and they all form one great mountain system. <hi rend="italic">See map on page 62</hi>. This mountain region was very unevenly uplifted, and some parts were formed long ages before others. Rain and ice and streams have long been at work wearing down the high land. It is so greatly worn away that beds of rock once deeply buried are now at the surface. It is in such deep layers of rock that gold and silver are formed.
</p>
<p>High mountains reach into the upper air, which is
cold even when the air in low valleys not many miles away is very warm.
</p>

<p>On the lofty peaks, three miles or more above sea level, the air is so thin, or rare, that many persons find it difficult to breathe there. Why is the lower air more dense? <hi rend="italic">See lesson 1</hi>.
</p>
 
<p>Winds blow freely around high mountains, and clouds form quickly in the cooled air as it rises over the ranges. When the air is cooled enough it gives out snow or rain. Snow often falls on the mountains while rain is falling in the lower valleys near by.
</p>
<p>On some high mountains snow lies all the year and becomes very deep. Part of the snow melts, but all the snow of one storm cannot melt before more falls. Rain soaks into the snow, making it more compact, and the heavy mass slowly changes into ice. As the layers of ice grow thicker they creep down the slopes. When the ice enters the lower valleys it melts and forms brooks or rivers.</p>

<p>A body of ice slowly moving down a slope is called a <hi rend="italic">glacier</hi>.
</p>
 

<p>Glaciers carry down whatever rolls upon them from the higher ground. They also drag along stones, gravel,clay beneath the ice, &mdash; scraping the surface over which they creep. When the ice melts it leaves the coarse rock waste near the melting ends, but most of the finer waste is carried away by the glacier streams. If
the coarse waste is left as a dam across a valley, as shown in the lower picture
on this page, a lake may be formed. Most of the lakes in the formed in this way by 
an northern part of our country were formed in this way by an ancient glacier or ice sheet, of which we shall learn more in later lessons.</p>
<pb n="11" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-011" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
<p>When glaciers push their way into the ocean <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-011-a" place="down the center"></figure> huge blocks of ice, called <hi rend="italic">icebergs</hi>, break off and float away.</p>

<p>Icebergs chill the damp air around them and thus cause thick clouds to form over the sea. Clouds floating close to the sea or the land are known as <hi rend="italic">fog</hi>. Many vessels have struck large blocks of floating ice in dense fogs and have been sunk or partly wrecked.

<p>8. Volcanoes</p>

<p>In many parts of the world melted rock, or <hi rend="italic">lava</hi>, has been pushed up through cracks in the surface rocks and has cooled in great cone-shaped heaps or in broad sheets. In some places this work is still going on.</p>

<p>Steam and other gases sometimes burst forth with the lava, shaking the ground and thus causing <hi rend="italic">earthquakes</hi>. The lava is then blown into fragments called <hi rend="italic">ashes</hi>, or even into fine dust that may be carried many miles by the wind. Most of the great cone-shaped heaps of ashes and lava have hollows, called <hi rend="italic">craters</hi>, in their tops, where the gases and ashes were blown out. Lava often escapes through cracks in the sides of the cones, as well as from the craters.</p>

<p>Some old craters are so large that they are called <hi rend="italic">valleys</hi>. Rain water may collect in them and form very deep and broad lakes.</p>

<p>Each of these cone-shaped masses lava and ashes is a <hi rend="italic">volcano</hi>. It may be no larger than a hill, or it may be two or three miles in height. Many mountains are old volcanoes.</p>

<p>The bursting forth of the lava or ashes from a volcano is called an <hi rend="italic">eruption</hi>. Many eruptions must take place to build up a great cone.</p>
<p>
The molten rock from volcanoes sometimes spreads out in wide plains. In some places the lava has poured through long cracks in the earth's surface and has formed plains that cover many thousand square miles.</p>

<p>A plain formed of lava is called a <hi rend="italic">lava plain</hi>.</p>

<p>The pictures on this page teach many facts about volcanoes. At the top we see a young cone of ashes, just forming; below is a volcano in eruption, sending out lava, gases and ashes; the third picture shows how a fresh flow of lava may look; the fourth is a lava plain so old that the lava has begun to crumble and furnish soil for bushes; the fifth shows the old age of a volcano, when all the cone has been torn down by the action of the weather and rains, leaving only the hard core or neck of lava that once filled the crater; even this neck of lava must in time crumble away; the lowest view shows a small volcano,with a flow of lava making a dam across a valley and thus causing lakes to form.</p>
<p>Sometimes volcanoes form under the sea and push their cones far above the surface. Many islands have been built up in this way. They are known as <hi rend="italic">volcanic islands</hi>.</p>

<p>9. Waves and Tides</p>

<p>Winds blowing over the sea make <hi rend="italic">waves</hi>. When the winds are very strong the waves may rise thirty or forty feet high, from trough to crest.</p>
<p>If a hanging rope is struck or shaken, wave-forms glide along it. The rope , simply bends to form the waves.</p>
<p>
The water in waves only rises and falls, like the waves in the rope, but the <hi rend="italic">wave-forms</hi> travel forward. The larger thay are the faster
<pb n="12" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-012" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
they travel. Storms at sea are dangerous chiefly on account of the waves. They pitch vessels about and sometimes wreck them.</p>
<p>The great waves produced in a storm may spread far across the ocean. They lose height as they go, and are called <hi rend="italic">swell</hi>. When
the swell approaches shallow water near shores it rolls up higher <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-012-a" place="upper part of the page"><figDesc>Three stages of the tide</figDesc></figure>
and forms <hi rend="italic">breakers</hi> or <hi rend="italic">surf</hi>. <hi rend="italic">See picture on page 2.
</hi></p>
<p>Waves on beaches often wash pebbles and sand up and down, grinding them finer and finer. Great storm waves are strong enough to move large blocks of rock.
</p>
<p>Twice <note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-012-1" n="1"></note>
 each day the ocean slowly rises and falls on its shores. For about six hours the water creeps up the beaches and against the foot of cliffs. During the next six hours it settles slowly back.</p>
<p>
This rise and fall of the ocean on its shores
is called the <hi rend="italic">tide</hi>. The flowing-in of the tide is called its<hi rend="italic"> flood</hi>; the flowing-out its <hi rend="italic">ebb</hi>.</p>

<p>The tides carry pure water into most harbors and help to keep them clean. The moving water scours and washes the harbors. Most harbors are thus cleansed twice a day.</p>
<p>
In some places the tide in the form of a high wave flows upstream in rivers, overturning boats and cutting the river banks.</p>

<p>The tide is not felt far out at sea, and it seldom rises very high on headlands; but in V-shaped bays the water may rise ten, twenty, thirty feet or more.</p>

<p>The tides are caused chiefly by the attraction of the moon. There is a tide on the side of the earth towards the moon, and another on the opposite side.<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-012-b" place="lower part of the page"><figDesc>The cut on the left shows a mountain region with a coastal plain. The rivers are building deltas<lb />
The picture above shows the same region sunk again partly beneath the sea, making deep bays. These pictures show the effect of the rising and sinking of coast lines.</figDesc></figure></p>
<p>
In the open ocean the tide, in the form of a very low wave thousands of miles wide, follows the moon; but on reaching the shallow waters near the shore, the tide is held back by the <note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-012-1" n="1">TO TEACHERS:&mdash; More exactly, in 24 hours and 50 minutes, since the moon does not go round the earth in just one day. Some places have but one tide a day; others have more than two tides in that time. This is chiefly due to tidal currents flowing to the same place from different directions.</note>
rubbing or friction of the water on the bottom. The tide then grows in height but lags behind the moon.</p>

<p>10. Shore Forms</p>
<p>
The three small pictures at the left show how this shore changes as the
tide flows and ebbs. When does the peninsula in the middle picture change to an island? What joins the peninsula to the mainland? What separates the island from the mainland? What two bodies of water does the strait connect? How many peninsulas can you find in these three little pictures? How many islands? How many bays?</p>

<p>An <hi rend="italic">island</hi> is land that has water all around it.</p>

<p>The word <hi rend="italic">peninsula</hi> means <hi rend="italic">almost an island</hi>. A neck of land joining a peninsula with another body of land is an <hi rend="italic">isthmus</hi>. An isthmus may be many miles wide, but it is narrower than the two bodies of land which it unites.
</p>
<p>A <hi rend="italic">strait</hi> is a body of water joining two larger bodies of water. Some straits are many miles wide; others are only a few feet in width. The word <hi rend="italic">strait</hi> means <hi rend="italic">narrow;</hi> a strait is narrower than the bodies of water that it connects.</p>

<p>Some long and shallow straits are called <hi rend="italic">sounds</hi>. This name may also be given to any body of water partly inclosed by islands.</p>

<p>Large arms of the sea are called <hi rend="italic">bays</hi>, <hi rend="italic">gulfs</hi> or <hi rend="italic">seas</hi>. Some of these are hundreds of miles long and wide.</p>

<p>Any body of water that affords shelter to vessels is known as a <hi rend="italic">harbor</hi>. Many fine harbors are found in the mouths of rivers and in bays formed by the sinking of valleys.</p>
<p>
Good harbors must be of such form as to shut out great storm waves. The water must be so deep that vessels will not strike on the bottom, but not too deep for letting down anchors to hold the vessels. The deep water should extend close to the shore or to the wharves, so that vessels can easily take on or put off freight.
The best harbors have high land round them, to shut out gales.</p>

 
<pb n="13" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-013" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
<p>One small picture at the bottom of page 12 shows an even coast line made by a smooth sea-bottom that has been lifted out of the water, forming a coastal plain. Rivers flowing across the plain have made deltas at their mouths. The picture beside it shows a very broken coast, with fine harbors, made by the sinking of the land shown in the other picture. Only the upper parts of the highlands remain; the lower parts of the valleys are filled with water.<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-013-a" place="middle of the page"></figure>
Nearly all the best harbors, except those in river mouths, have been formed by the settling of hilly land partly beneath the sea.</p>
<p>
When smooth or level sea-bottoms rise out of the sea they form straight or gently curving shore lines.</p>

<p>Along such shores there are but few bays in which vessels can
find shelter from winds and waves; but there may be good harbors in mouths of rivers flowing into the sea.</p>

<p>In places where rough or rugged lands have partly sunk beneath the sea the water has flowed into the valleys between the hills or mountains and made very <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-013-b" place="lower middle of the page"><figDesc>Houses wrecked by storm waves on a sandy beach</figDesc></figure>uneven or broken shore lines. The water may wholly or partly surround some hills and make islands or peninsulas.</p>

<p>There are good harbors along such coasts. Vessels can run
into the bays or find shelter behind islands. Many people
living near such coasts become good sailors.</p>


 
<p>Storm waves slowly wear away parts of some coasts. The waves beat most violently on headlands that jut far out into the sea. As these are worn back, their steep faces form <hi rend="italic">sea cliffs</hi>.</p>
<p>
Sand and gravel often form <hi rend="italic">beaches</hi> at the foot of cliffs. Part of the rock waste is also carried by waves along the
shores, where it spreads out into beaches, or builds bars that cut off parts of bays and make the shores straighter. Waves also gather sand from some shallow bottoms and throw it up in bars. The parts of bays cut off by bars are called <hi rend="italic">lagoons</hi>.</p>
<p>
Soil from the land washes into the lagoons, and when they become shallow enough many water plants grow there. In time the lagoons may thus be filled with mud, roots and stems, forming <hi rend="italic">marshes</hi>. <hi rend="italic">See picture</hi>. There are many thousand acres of marshy
land formed in this way along the eastern coast of our country.</p>

<p>On the other side of the earth are two great land bodies. The smaller is called <hi rend="italic">Australia</hi>; it also has the sea on all sides.
The other land area is the largest on the earth. Two long arms of the sea almost cut off one part, called <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>, from the other part, called <hi rend="italic">Eurasia</hi>, but the <hi rend="italic">isthmus of Suez</hi> unites them. A canal crosses this isthmus.</p>

 <note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-014-1" n="1">The word <hi rend="italic">Eurasia</hi> means <hi rend="italic">Europe-Asia</hi>, and is made of the first three letters of Europe (<hi rend="italic">Eur</hi>) prefixed to Asia. Europe, although in <hi rend="italic">form</hi> a long and broad peninsula west of Asia, has its distinct mountain system, climate, industries, commercial relations, art, literature, civilization and, in modern times, its distinctive place in the world's history. In its bearing on the world's present development, Europe far excels Asia and is entitled to a separate and prominent place in geography and history. It is of course well to call attention to the relation of these areas, as of all others, in form and position, but to continue the treatment of the two together is not practical nor in line with modern science.<lb />

In climate, plants, animals, rues of people, art, literature and history, as well as in scores of other relations, Europe resembles North America a hundredfold more closely than southern Asia resembles the other parts of the <hi rend="italic">same continent</hi> in and north of the great highland of Tibet.<lb />

Europe, one of the greatest factors in the world's progress, should not be obscured by treating it as a mere appendage to Asia, simply because two plains in the north, once separated by the sea, now lie on opposite sides of a low mountain range. Modern botany, zo&ouml;logy and ethnology often consider Europe as part of a region or realm (<hi rend="italic">Afeurasia</hi>) consisting of the part of Africa north of the Sahara, the whole of Europe and the part of Asia in and north of the great highland of Tibet; but <hi rend="italic">no authority in any science </hi> considers Europe and all Asia together as a unit.

<p>In the far north three of these large divisions of land, North
America, Europe and Asia, circle partly round the north pole. Only two of them, South America and Africa, are crossed by the equator. Australia alone is wholly south of the equator.
</p>

<p> There are six large divisions of land called <hi rend="italic">continents</hi>. In the order of size, beginning with the largest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Europe and Australia. </p>

<p>North America is the continent on which we live. It is not quite half so large as Asia, but it is twice as large as Europe. North America and Europe together about equal Africa in size.</p>

<p>Maps like those on the opposite page are made to show the two sides of the earth. They are called maps of the <hi rend="italic">hemispheres</hi>. The one that contains America is the <hi rend="italic">western hemisphere</hi>; the other is the <hi rend="italic">eastern hemisphere.</hi> The eastern hemisphere is also called the <hi rend="italic">Old World</hi>, because the white people lived there long before America, or the <hi rend="italic">New World</hi>, was discovered.</p>

 To TEACHERS: &mdash;Explorers have found land in a few parts of the Antarctic ocean, and some writers have gone so far as to locate an Antarctic continent. In the light of actual present knowledge, this is <hi rend="italic">fancy</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>.</note>

<p>12. The Oceans</p>
<p>
The great body of salt water that lies in the broad valleys between the continents is called the<hi rend="italic"> sea</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">ocean</hi>.
Various parts of this one great sea are also called <hi rend="italic">oceans</hi>.</p>

<p>Most parts of the sea <hi rend="italic">within a few miles of the land</hi> are shallow. Far from the shores the sea is in many places two miles deep, and in some places it is four or five miles deep.</p>

<p>The land and the <hi rend="italic">surface </hi>of the sea have light by day and darkness by night. They have also warm and cold seasons; but no sunshine reaches the deep parts of the sea. The deep water of the ocean is always cold and dark.</p>
<p>
The land has many valleys and mountains; but a large part of the sea-bottom is a great smooth plain.</p>

<p>The wind blows dust and sand over the land and also makes waves on the surface of the sea; but the deep sea is very still.</p>

<p>Part of the rain falling on the land feeds rivers which wear deep valleys and wash the loose soil down the slopes to the sea. Nearly all the soil that enters the sea settles in the shallow water near the shores. The smooth bottom of the deep parts of the sea hardly changes at all, for there are no streams to wear waters.</p>

<p>Seaweeds, fish and other forms of life abound in the shallow waters near the seashores; but the cold dark depths of the sei have only a few, if any, plants, and not nearly so many kinds o: animals as live either in the shore-waters or on the land.</p>

<pb n="16" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-016" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
<p>Animals and plants, or parts of them, are often <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-016-a" place="middle of the page"></figure>buried in the layers of sand and mud at the bottom of the sea. During long ages many such layers form and gradually harden to rock. The remains of animals or plants bedded in the rock are called <hi rend="italic">fossils</hi>. When fossils of creatures that live only in the sea are found bedded in rocks that now form part of the dry land we know that such rocks were once part of the bed. of the sea. <hi rend="italic">See text about coastal plains, lesson 6.
</hi></p>
<p>
We may think of the vast body of water spreading round the south pole as the main body from which all other parts of the sea extend like arms. Thus, the <hi rend="italic">Pacific ocean</hi> is a broad arm of the sea reaching northward between the west coast of America and the Old World.</p>
<p>
The Pacific is. the largest of the oceans. It is much larger than all the lands of the earth put together. It covers more than one third of the earth's surface and is twice as large as any other ocean.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Atlantic ocean</hi> is a long crooked arm of the sea also stretching northward, but on the east side of America.</p>
<p>
This ocean is only half as large as the Pacific, but towards its shores slope
many wide fertile plains. Thousands of ships help in the exchange of the products of the fields, the mines and the workshops of the rich lands that border on the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Arctic ocean</hi> is like a great gulf at the northern end of the Atlantic, and lies between the bleak northern shores of America and the Old World.</p>

<p>Most parts of the Arctic ocean are always covered with ice. The lands along its borders are very cold, and the soil thaws only to the depth of a few inches during a few of the warmest weeks of summer. The Arctic ocean has about the same area as Europe.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Indian ocean</hi> is a broad arm of the sea partly between Africa and Australia.</p>

<p>The Indian ocean is much larger than Asia, but is only one third as large as the Pacific. This is the warmest of the oceans; only its southern part enters the region of ice.</p>

</p>

 
<p>North America is shaped like a triangle. It is broad in the north and
tapers towards the south. The three sides of the triangle are formed by the coasts of three oceans. Two very large arms of the sea indent the coast, namely, the <hi rend="italic">gulf of Mexico</hi> on the southeast, and <hi rend="italic">Hudson bay</hi> on the northeast.

along the shores of the Arctic ocean. They feed chiefly on seals and other creatures caught on the ice or in the cold waters.</p>
 <p>What ocean is east of North America? West of it? North of it?
</p>
<p>North America consists mainly of a great western highland, a lesser eastern highland and a broad plain between. This plain reaches from the warm low shores
of the gulf of Mexico to the frozen shores along the Arctic ocean.</p>
<p>
The great highland in the western part of North America is known as the <hi rend="italic">Rocky mountain highland</hi>. It includes the plateaus and ranges forming a chain from the isthmus of Panama to Bering strait. This highland lies along the coast of the Pacific, and also spreads far inland.</p>

<p>The part of the Rocky mountain highland in <hi rend="italic">Mexico</hi>, the country just west of the gulf of Mexico, is very high but not very wide, though it reaches from the gulf on the east to the ocean on the west.</p>

<p>North of Mexico, in the <hi rend="italic">United States</hi>, the highland is much wider. Great ranges of mountains rise along its east and west sides, and many other


<pb n="18" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-018" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
ranges lie between them. This part of the highland has the richest gold mines in the world.</p>


<p>Farther north, in the land known as <hi rend="italic">Canada</hi>, the lofty ranges still continue, but the highland is not quite so wide.
</p>
<p>The region reaching from Mexico to the isthmus of Panama is known as <hi rend="italic">Central America</hi>.
</p>
<p>The lesser highland in the eastern part of the United States is called the <hi rend="italic">Appalachian highland</hi>. It has the same general direction as the Atlantic coast, but in most places is somewhat back from that coast. Its ranges are much lower than those in the far west.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-018-a" place="up middle on the right of left column of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Reaping grain in Central plain</hi></figDesc></figure>
<p>Between the highlands of the east and the west stretches the great Central plain. Nearly all of the part of this plain in our country is drained by the Mississippi river and its many branches flowing to the gulf of Mexico. Other rivers much farther north show that the other part of the Central plain slopes towards the colder portions of the earth.
</p>
<p>In this Central plain lies a chain of very large lakes, called the <hi rend="italic">Great Lakes</hi>. The lands around them rank among the richest in the world. There are fertile farms raising immense crops of wheat and corn. Millions of cattle and horses graze in the fields. Many people live in these plains, and large cities have grown in places best suited to trade, but especially along the shores of the Great Lakes. The fertile plains spreading round these lakes are called <hi rend="italic">prairies</hi>.
</p>
<p>The St. Lawrence river flows from the lowest of the Great Lakes to the sea.
</p>
<p>The southern part of the great plain in the States is the best cotton region of the earth.
</p>
<p>The plain in the far north along the Arctic shores is frozen all the year, except when the summer sun thaws the soil for a few inches in depth.
</p>
<p>Both the gulf of Mexico and Hudson bay are arms of the Atlantic ocean. The great gulf is inn the warm part of the earth; the great bay is in a much colder region.
</p>
<p>At the entrance to the gulf of Mexico lies the warm and fertile island of Cuba. A few miles north of this island the peninsula of Florida helps to inclose the gulf of Mexico. Cuba is the largest of a great group of islands called the <hi rend="italic">West Indies</hi>.
</p>
<p>Islands that are buried in ice and snow a large part of the time lie near the entrance to Hudson bay. Far to the northeast is the cold and barren island of Greenland.

</p>
<p>In general the surface of South America resembles that of North America. Each has its greatest or primary highland on the west, with lesser highlands on the east, and a great plain between.
</p>
<p>The highland which lies along the west coast of South America is known as the <hi rend="italic">Andes highland</hi>, or simply the <hi rend="italic">Andes</hi>. It is not nearly so wide as the Rocky mountain highland, but it has much higher plateaus.

</p>
<p>The white and the black people in this highland raise most of the coffee used in our country. The region is in a hot part of the earth, not far south of the equator. It is in such hot hilly land, having plenty of rainfall, that coffee thrives best.
</p>
<p>The western half of Brazil is part of the Central plain and contains vast forests called <hi rend="italic">selvas</hi>. Most of the trees grow in the lowlands along the rivers that form the <hi rend="italic">Amazon system</hi>. The Amazon river and its branches drain the largest river basin in the world. The selvas are in this basin. Most of the largest rivers of the Amazon system flow from the Andes highland.
</p>
<p>In what direction does the Amazon flow? Into what ocean? 
</p>
<p>The Amazon river flows almost parallel with the equator and not far from it. The land is low and hot, and is suited to the growth of many kinds of trees and smaller plants. Many tribes of Indians live by hunting and fishing in the forests and streams of the selvas.
</p>
<p>The part of the Central plain south of the selvas is grassy and supports millions of cattle and horses. In that land such grassy plains are called <hi rend="italic">pampas</hi>.

</p>
<p>The Alps are famous for the beauty and grandeur of their lake and mountain scenery. Every summer thousands of tourists visit the Alps. These mountains are about halfway between the equate and the north pole. The Swiss people live among the Alps.

The portion of this wide plain that crosses Asia belongs also to Russia, and is known as <hi rend="italic">Siberia</hi>.
</p>
<p>The southern half of the great plain in Europe raises about the same  kinds of farm products as the prairies round the Great Lakes in North America. There are wheat and corn and other grains, as well as rich grass for cattle.
</p>
<p>Towards the north the plains are colder, and fewer grains can be raised. In the far north, near the Arctic shores, the ground is frozen as in the northern part of the Central plain of North America.

<p>This continent has a very irregular coast line, and is surrounded on the east and south by large bays.
</p>

<p>The surface of this great continent may be divided roughly into three parts, &mdash; the wide and lofty Asian highland, often called the <hi rend="italic">highland of Tibet;</hi> the broad plains of Siberia the on the north; the less broad plains on east and south.

<p>The highland of Tibet is the loftiest mountain region on the earth.  Even in the hottest part of  summer the highest mountains are buried in snow for a distance of two miles from their tops. The greater part of this highland is a lofty plateau. It is so high that the air there is very cold, except during the days of a short summer season.
</p>


<p>The effect of such a mountain wall is very marked. Plants that grow in the warm slopes on the south could not live so far up in the cold lands, even if their seeds were carried there. The animals that feed on the plants of lowlands cannot cross such high ranges, as they cannot find food. People living on one side of the highland cannot
 

<pb n="21" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-021" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
trade with people on the other side without going round the great mass of high land; they cannot carry the goods over the rough
mountain passes without much difficulty.</p>
<p>We have seen that the plains in Siberia form part of a great plain stretching across all Eurasia, from ocean to ocean. The course of the rivers shows that the general slope of this plain in Asia is towards the northern ocean.</p>
<p>In Asia, as in Europe, grains and grasses thrive in the warmer southern part of the plain; but the northern part is cold and barren.</p>
<p>The most important plains of Asia are east and south of the highland of Tibet.. On the east, along the Pacific shore, are rich plains that form part of the great country called China. Most parts of these plains are the deltas of long rivers. The soil is very rich and supports hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>In the ocean east of China lies a group of islands forming the country of <hi rend="italic">Japan</hi>.</p>
<p>Most of the yellow people on the earth live in China and Japan. They are famous

Many million people live in India, and they belong in the great family of white people. The lofty highland of Tibet separates the yellow people of China from the white people of India.</p>
<p>The southwest part of Asia consists mainly of plateaus crossed by mountain ranges, but not nearly so high as the plateaus and ranges of the highland of Tibet. Many parts of southwest Asia are deserts, but there are fertile river valleys. The great peninsula of Arabia, east of the Red sea, is chiefly a desert plateau, but it is famous for its coffee. </p>
<p>Arabia is the home of the people called Arabs, but they are found also in the countries of northern Africa. Many of them make their homes in the fertile spots round springs in the desert. They raise some grain and many date trees. The Arabs use many camels and horses.</p>

<p>The largest desert in the world is in northern Africa. It reaches from the Atlantic ocean to the Red sea, except where a narrow but fertile river valley, called the <hi rend="italic">Nile</hi>, crosses it. The greater part of this desert is known as the <hi rend="italic">Sahara</hi>, meaning <hi rend="italic">great desert.</hi></p>
 <p>Plants that grow south of the Sahara they can find the right kind of soil and the amount of rainfall they need, but they cannot spread across the dry sands of the desert. Animals that feed on such plants are not able to cross the desert. Like the great highland of Tibet, this is another boundary which is very hard for people, plants and the lower animals to pass.</p>

<p>The long river Nile has its source in a large lake under the equator. Some of the branches of this river rise in the great highland of eastern Africa.</p>
<p>The Nile flows northward across the eastern side of the great desert of northern Africa and is building larger and larger its broad delta in the Mediterranean sea, This is one of the rivers that have often overflowed their banks and have made flood plains or rich meadow lands, The Nile overflows every year.

<div type="section"><head>CLIMATE OF THE EARTH</head>
<p>18. Latitude and Longitude</p>
<p>By the climate of a place is meant the usual state of its atmosphere, &mdash; whether hot or cold, dry or rain-giving, healthful or unhealthful.</p> 
<p>In studying the climate of any place we need to know about how far it is from the equator, what its seasons are, whether
it is on high land or low land, whether its winds are hot or cold, dry or moist. First, let us learn how to locate
places on the earth.</p>
<p>Every circle, both large and small, may be divided into 360 equal parts, each of which is  called a degree.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-023-1"></note> </p>
<p>How many degrees are there in one fourth of a circle? One fourth of a small circle contains just as
many degrees as one fourth of a large one.</p>
<p>The distance from the equator to either pole is ninety degrees (90&deg;), or one fourth of a circle running north and south round the earth.</p>
<p>Round a globe we can draw any number of circles parallel with the equator. Such circles are called <hi rend="italic">parallels</hi>. All the places on any one parallel are at the same distance from the equator.</p>
<p>Parallels show how far places are north or south of the equator. We name the parallels with the equator as zero (written 0&deg;).</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-023-c"><figDesc>Degrees of latitude</figDesc></figure>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-023-d"><figDesc>Parallels of latitude</figDesc></figure>
<p>A parallel may be at 1&deg;, 8&deg;, 45&deg;, or any number of degrees as high as ninety, from the equator.</p>
<note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-023-1"> A 60th part of a degree is called a <hi rend="italic">minute</hi>. A 60th part of a minute is called a <hi rend="italic">second</hi>.  Ten degrees, thirty minutes and forty seconds may be written 10&deg; 30' 40".</note>

<p>Thus the city of New Orleans is 30&deg; north of the equator,&mdash; written 30&deg; N. It is one third of the distance from the equator the north pole. <hi rend="italic">See map of North America, page 65. </hi>But there are many other places round the earth on the same parallel, or at the same distance from the equator.</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-024-a"><figDesc>Degree of longitude</figDesc></figure>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-024-b"><figDesc>Meridians of longitude</figDesc></figure>
<p>On the globe we can also draw many lines running from pole to pole, north and south. All places on any one of the north-and-south lines have midday at the same time. These lines are therefore called <hi rend="italic">meridians, </hi>meaning <hi rend="italic">midday lines.</hi></p>
<p>We may think of any number of meridians and number meaning the first. The meridian from which the others are counted is marked zero (0&deg;), just as the equator is the zero (0&deg;) line from which all parallels are numbered north or south.</p>  
<p>The prime or <hi rend="italic">zero </hi>meridian most commonly used by sailors passes through the observatory of <hi rend="italic">Greenwich,</hi>a suburb of London. This is known as the <hi rend="italic">meridian of Greenwich </hi>and is marked 0&deg; on maps. <hi rend="italic">See map of British Isles.</hi></p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-024-c"><figDesc>Ferns growing on trees in India, where the seasons are always hot or warm</figDesc></figure>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-024-e"><figDesc>Eskimo boy</figDesc></figure>
<p>The meridians which show degrees are generally numbered from 1&deg; to 180&deg; east from Greenwich, and also 1&deg; to 180&deg; west from the same prime meridian. These numbers count the degrees round any parallel on which a place is located.</p>
<p>Now we can locate the city of New Orleans exactly, by saying that it is 30&deg; north of the equator, and 90&deg; along this parallel west of Greenwich. It is thus one third of the distance from the equator towards the north pole, and one fourth of the way round the world west from Greenwich. This may be written 90&deg; W. and 30&deg; N.</p>
<p>The number of degrees that any place is north or south of the equator is called the latitude of that place. The number of degrees east or west of any chosen meridian is the <hi rend="italic">longitude.</hi></p>
<p>Latitude means <hi rend="italic">breadth; </hi>longitude means <hi rend="italic">length. </hi>In ancient times, when nearly all the shipping in the world was on the N.P.Mediterranean sea, people thought of the long way as east and west; the broad way as north and south.</p>

The important facts to be kept in mind are that degrees of latitude are practically equal, and that each contains 60 nautical or 69&half; common miles. This is also the length of a degree of longitude on the equator but degrees of longitude vary with distance from the equator.</note>

<p>19. Change of Seasons <note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-025-1">1</note>
</p>
<p>The sun is a very hot globe, more than a million times as large as the earth. This great globe is very far away, yet it keeps the earth warm enough to support the life that is on it.</p>
<p>The average distance of the sun from the earth is about 93,000,000 miles.</p>
  <p>If, when Columbus set sail on his first voyage to America, some sun and traveled at the rate of twenty five miles an hour towards the earth, that object would still be many million miles away from the earth.</p> 
<p>The sun's rays shine through clear air without warming it very much, but they warm the clouds and the dust in the air, and also the surface of the land and the sea. All these help to warm the air about them, but the land and the sea warm the air much more than the clouds and the dust do.</p>
<p>When the sun is highest in the sky about noontime, its rays heat the earth more than late in the afternoon or early in the morning, when they are more slanting.</p>
<p>Fig. 1 on page 24 shows how the sun shines on different parts of the earth. Over the line B all the rays are nearly vertical. Over the line A the rays strike the earth with much greater slant. As many rays shine on B as on A, but the slanting rays spread over more surface and, therefore, cannot heat it so much. The more nearly vertical the rays are, the greater their heating power, because more rays can reach a space of a given size.</p>
<p>Fig. 2 shows the same fact. It is just as far along the surface from the line marked <hi rend="italic">Arctic circle </hi>to the north pole as it is from the line marked <hi rend="italic">tropic of Cancer </hi>to the equator, but compare the number of rays shining on each.</p>

<p>Once a year the earth moves or <hi rend="italic">revolves </hi>round the sun, in an almost circular path. This path of the earth is called its <hi rend="italic">orbit.</hi><note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-025-2"></note> The journey round the sun is called the <hi rend="italic">revolution </hi>of the earth.</p>

<p>What other motion of the earth have you studied? <hi rend="italic">See lesson 2. </hi>What is the cause of day and night?</p>
<p>The earth's axis does <hi rend="italic">not stand upright </hi>from the orbit or path, but <hi rend="italic">leans over </hi>about one quarter from the upright. As the earth goes round the sun, the <hi rend="italic">axis always points to
</hi><hi rend="italic">the same spot </hi>far off in the sky, near the north star.</p>
<p>Maps (A) and (B) on this page show how the warm sunshine strikes North America, Asia and other lands north of the equator when that part of the earth leans towards the sun's rays. The same map shows how slanting the rays are at that time on the lands south of the equator.</p>
<p>Maps (C) and (D) show how the sunshine reaches the earth when it has moved round to the other side of the sun. The lands south of the equator now feel the strong rays, while the lands north of the equator have the weaker or slanting rays.</p>
<p>Some evening at home, with a ball and a light placed near the middle of a room, you can see how all this happens. Run a long needle through the ball, for an axis. Hold the ball a little way off from the lamp, but as high as the light, and turn the ball so that one end of the needle points towards one of the upper corners of the room. Look and see which part of the ball is lighted.
</p>
<p>Then move the ball slowly round the light, keeping the ball on a level with the light, and also keeping the needle pointed always towards the <hi rend="italic">same corner </hi>of the room. You will see the pole, where the needle enters the ball, go into darkness part of the way and come out into the light the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Thus it is with the earth. The axis always points to one spot in the sky; and as the earth goes round the sun, the sunshine changes slowly from north to south and then from south to north.</p>
<p>The change of sunshine from north to south and then from south to north, as the earth goes round the sun, is called the <hi rend="italic">change of seasons. </hi>Lands have their warmest weather when they are leaning towards the sun, with the rays more nearly vertical than during the time of coldest weather, when they are leaning away from the sun. Then the rays are more slanting.</p>
<p>Thus, the slanting of the earth's axis, and the fact that it always points to one spot in the sky, as the great globe
<note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-025-1"> The change of seasons and the length of days and nights are subjects that
can best be explained by the teacher with a globe in hand.</note>

travels round the sun, cause the <hi rend="italic">change of seasons</hi>. If the axis stood upright, the rays would always fall on a place at noon with the same slant, and there would be no change of seasons.</p>




<p>When lands have spring and summer they are leaning towards the sun; when they have autumn and winter they are leaning away from the sun. The axis does not change its direction, but the earth moves round from one side of the sun to the other, so as to bring the strong rays first on one side of the equator and then on the other.</p>
<p>The large diagram on this page shows the <hi rend="italic">true form of the earth's orbit</hi> and also the position of the earth in its orbit each month of the year. Look at the little globe for March; the sunshine covers one half the earth from pole to pole, for the sun is over the equator. At this time the season of spring begins in the north.</p>
<p>The globe for April shows the sunshine reaching even beyond the north pole, for the northern hemisphere is leaning slowly towards the sun. The south pole has gone into darkness. In May the north pole has come farther into the circle of sunlight, while the south pole has sunk farther into the circle of darkness that covers the other side of the earth. In June the sunshine covers long night, or time of darkness, but the south pole is coming back towards the light. At last, in September the circle of light and warmth is back just where it was in March; the sun is then over the equator, and autumn begins in the north.</p>
<p>But now a change takes place, and in July and August the sunshine grows less and less north of the equator. The north pole is moving slowly back towards its long night, or time of darkness, but the south pole is coming back towards the light. At last, in September the circle of light and warmth is back just where it was in March; the sun is then over the equator, and autumn begins in the north.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-026-1"></note></p>
<p>From now on the north pole goes into darkness, as the northern lands turn farther away from the sun. October and November find the sunshine still less in the northern hemisphere. In December the northern half of the earth is turned farthest from the sun, and the north pole is deep within the circle of darkness.In this month winter begins in the north.</p>
<p>Now the north pole begins to move slowly towards the light. January and February carry the sunshine farther north, and in March the sun rises once more in sight of the north pole and brings back the spring to the northern lands.</p>
<p>South of the equator the seasons are just opposite to those of the north When spring begins in the northern m hemisphere autumn begins south of the of the equator it is summer on the other.</p>
<p>When the sun is over the equator the light reaches both poles. Then the days and nights are each twelve hours long over the whole
earth.</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-026-a"><figDesc>Diagram showing true shape of the earth's orbit; also position of the earth each month in the orbit</figDesc></figure>
<p>When the sun is north of the equator the hours of sunshine on that side of the equator are longer than the hours of darkness; but when the sun is south of the equator the nights in the north are longer than the days.</p>
<p>During the northern spring and summer the light never leaves the north pole and the day there is six months long. It is then night at the south pole. During the northern autumn and winter the north pole has its long night and the south pole its day.</p>

<p>20. The Zones</p>
<p>We have seen that the axis of the earth leans about one quarter from the upright. The exact amount of the leaning or inclination of the axis is 23&half;&deg;. When the earth is in that part of its path which brings the northern end of the axis nearest the a line at about one fourth of the distance from the equator towards the north pole. This line round the earth, upon which the vertical rays fall when farthest north, is called the <hi rend="italic">tropic of Cancer</hi>.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-027-1"></note>
</p>
<p>The line upon which the vertical rays fall when the <hi rend="italic">tropic of Capricorn</hi>. Find on each of the maps on page 25 the exact place where the vertical rays strike the earth.</p>
<p>The tropics are 23&half;&deg; on each side of the equator. The wide belt off land and water lying between or within the tropics is called the <hi rend="italic">torrid zone</hi>.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-027-2"></note> This great zone of strong sunshine is more than 3000 miles wide, and spreads round the earth along the equator nearly 25,000 miles.</p>
<p>When the sun is farthest north it shines all day within the Arctic circle. When farthest south it shines all day within the Antarctic circle. This shows that these circles are just as far from the poles as the tropics are from the equator, namely, 23&half;&deg;. The Arctic and Antarctic circles are known as the <hi rend="italic">polar circles</hi>.</p>
<p>Map A on this page shows the limits of light when the sun is vertical over the tropic of Cancer; the light reaches just to the polar circles on either side; but in the north it reaches the farthest edge of the Arctic circle and sheds its light over
all the land and water within the circle. In the,south the light reaches only the outer edge of the circle, and all within is dark and cold. <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-027-a"><figDesc>Map A, showing vertical rays over the tropic of Cancer</figDesc></figure></p>

<p>As the sun shines farther and farther north, and the earth turns daily on its axis, there is a growing cap or circle of constant daylight round the north pole. When the sun is farthest north this cap of constant light covers all the land and sea within the Arctic circle. But as the sun seems to move away from the tropic of Cancer the light within the polar circle of the north fades slowly away, and when the sun reaches the tropic of Capricorn the region within the Arctic circle is in darkness. As the light leaves the frozen region within one polar circle it reaches more and more into the other.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-027-3"></note> </p>
<p>The region within the Arctic circle is called the <hi rend="italic">north frigid zone</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">south frigid zone</hi> is within the Antarctic circle.</p>

The nearer the poles, the longer the great period of daylight lasts.<lb />
The two polar regions have, of course, the same number of light and of dark periods. The longest period of daylight in any place within either of the polar circles lasts during the longest period of darkness in some place just as far within the other polar circle.

the long winter nights. The larger the land area, the greater is the difference between its warm and its cold seasons.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Frigid Zones. </hi>The rays that enter the frigid zones are laming and weak. The air there is always cold or cool,
nd ice covers the greater part of both zones. These polar regions are known as the cold belts. The cold belts, or frigid zones, have very long and cold winters and short cool summers.</p>
<p>During the long winter nights how cold the air of these regions must become! Ice and snow cover the land and almost all parts of the polar seas. Only a small portion of the Arctic ocean is kept open by water drifting from the warmer parts of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Even during the long daylight of summer the air of the cold belts cannot become very warm, because most parts of the land and the sea round the poles are covered with ice and snow, and a large part of the sunshine is taken to melt a portion of this frozen cover.</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-028-a"></figure>
<p>The few people living within the northern cold belt are found mostly near the shores past which the warmer waters drift from the south. These people get their food mainly by hunting or fishing or by tending herds of reindeer. No people live in the cold
belt of the south.</p>
<p>Brilliant lights, called the aurora or northern lights, sometimes appear in the polar skies, and are also seen from places far beyond the frigid zones. The aurora diminishes the darkness of the long polar nights.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Temperate Zones</hi>. Between the frigid zones and the torrid zone lie the temperate zones. These zones are very wide. Over the parts near the tropics the sunshine falls with not very much slant; but over the parts nearer the polar circles the rays fall with more slant. We may therefore divide each temperate zone into two heat belts, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">a warm belt</hi> lying next to the hot belt, or torrid zone; and a cool belt next to the cold belt, or frigid zone.</p>
<p>In the north temperate zone the line which divides the warm belt from the cool belt crosses east and west about through the middle of the United States; and in the Old World the line runs about east and west along the main highlands of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>In the south temperate zone nearly all the land, except the very southern parts of the continents, are in the warm belt.</p>
<p>Between the heat belts there are no sudden changes from hot to warm, from warm to cool or from cool to cold. All the way from
the belt of greatest heat to the places of greatest cold, there is only a very gradual change.</p>
<p>In the northern cool belt the lands are very wide. There the winter days are short, and the sunshine of that season is slanting and weak. The winters are therefore very cold, especially in the northern part, where snow covers the ground for several months each year, and where heavy frosts are common during the spring and autumn.</p>
<p>In the cool belt of the south there is not much land. The air over the oceans remains steadily cool, while over the narrow lands it varies only from cool to warm.</p>
<p>The lands in the northern warm belt are wide, but the days and nights do not differ much in length, and the sun's rays are never very slanting. The winters on the land are cool but not cold. The summers are very hot.</p>
<p>The winters and summers of the lands in the southern warm belt are well marked, but as the lands are small compared with the oceans in the same belt, the change from winter to summer is not so great as in the warm belt of the north.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Torrid Zone</hi>. In the torrid zone the sun's rays are vertical, or nearly so, at noon every day. Thus, the slant of the sunshine varies but little. The days and nights are always about equal. There the change of seasons is very slight, and there is no winter. The air over the lands of this zone, except of course high lands, is hot or warm all the year. This zone is often called the hot belt.</p>
<p>As the position of the sun shifts north and south, the weather of all the heat belts shifts with it, back and forth, once a year.</p>
<p>During our summer hot weather reaches beyond the torrid zone and spreads over the warm and part of the cool belts; the warm
weather shifts into the cool belt; the cool weather moves into the

 
<pb n="29" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-029" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
cold belt; the belt of cold weather round the poles becomes smaller. During our winter the cold weather of the northern cold belt spreads far southward over the cool belt; the warm belt then feels the cool weather; and the warm weather is felt only borders of the hot belt.</p>
<p>South of the equator the opposite changes are meanwhile taking place. When the warmer weather spreads northward over the belts north of the equator the cooler weather follows it from the regions south of it; but owing to the smallness of the southern lands and the vastness of the oceans, the seasons south of the equator do not present great extremes of heat or cold.</p>
<p>In all the heat belts the high plateaus and the mountains are cooler than the lowlands. Even near the equator the summits of very
high mountains are covered with snow all the year.</p>
<p>By climbing any very high mountain near the equator, a person may feel the same changes in climate as in going from the equator
to either pole. Five miles up the air is as cold as it is five <hi rend="italic">thousand</hi> miles along the surface of the earth towards either pole.</p>
<p>Not all places in the same latitude have the same seasons. Some are in highlands, others in lowlands some are near the sea, others far inland; warm winds blow over some, cold winds over others. We shall study these differences, tinder the various countries.</p>

<p>Vapor rises from the oceans and other bodies of water,as well as from wet lands, and the winds carry it about. When the air is cooled it cannot vapor as when it is warmer. When cooled enough the vapor in it forms clouds from which rain or snow falls.</p>
<p>When the air is growing warmer it can hold more and more vapor, and it then takes up more vapor and dries the lands over which it passes. Winds that are growing warmer as they blow towards warmer parts of the earth are therefore called <hi rend="italic">drying winds</hi>.</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-029-b"><figDesc>Cutting ice on a river of the cool belt in winter</figDesc></figure>
<p>Cold air weighs more, or is heavier, than hot air. Just as a stick, being lighter than water, will float on it, so
warm air will float on cool air. The cooler air flows towards and creeps under the warmer air, pushing it
upwards.</p>

<p>Not all parts of the earth are heated alike, and the air is therefore kept in motion. The air from the cooler parts is
flowing towards the warmer parts. Some of the currents of air move along the earth's surface, and others flow far above it. We call the surface currents winds; they are very useful, as we have just learned.</p>
<p>Winds blow from cold parts of the earth towards the warmer parts, from cold seas to warm lands or from warm ocean currents to cold lands, from grassy plains to hot deserts, from cool mountains into warmer valleys or from cool shaded valleys up the bare and hot slopes of sunny foothills.</p>
<p>When we think of the many kinds of surface that help to warm or to cool the air, it does not seem strange that the winds do not always blow with equal force or in the same paths. With frozen lands and seas, parched deserts, cool grassy plains, shady forests, warm and cold ocean currents, snow and rain, flying clouds and, above all, the shifting sunshine that causes the seasons,&mdash;with these and other causes of difference in heat, the air finds little rest.</p>

<pb n="30" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-030" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
<p>Strong winds cannot reach soil that is covered with grass or trees, but in dry lands where there are but few plants the winds sweep over the ground and scatter dust and sand far and wide. Coarse sand is drifted along like dry snow in winter.</p>
<p>The grains of sand are blown against one another and against bare rocks. Thus, both the sand and the rocks are ground to dust.
</p>
<p>In deserts, where drifting sand is plentiful, it gathers in the form of hills called dunes. Some of these dunes, or hills of drifted sand, are from three to six hundred feet high. One of the pictures on this page shows several desert dunes.</p>
<p>Dunes are also found on sandy shores. Waves throw sand upon the beaches, and the winds may then drift it inland. Fields, forests and villages are sometimes buried by drifting sand.</p>
<p>Under the sands of deserts lies the bed rock. The winds often blow away the grains of sand from the high parts of the bed rock, as soon as they weather crumble. Parts of deserts may thus See the picture of the wind-swept desert, where the Arabs are resting beside the camel. This picture shows many such wind-swept hills.</p>
 <p>Winds not only blow dust and sand about, but they also brush along the surface of the sea and make waves. The waves which roll against the land wash stones and sand back and forth on the sea shore, grinding them very fine.Thus, the winds help to change
the seashores of the earth.The winds blowing steadily over the sea also make currents in the sea. Warm currents from the
hot belt may flow the air that blows over these currents later  to the people even as far  northward and warm cold lands. We shall study and shall find that they are north as the Arctic circle.</p>
<p>Moist winds blowing towards cooler lands often give out rainfall. They also shed rains on high ranges that lift up the air and cool it.</p>

<p>Winds carry vapor from the sea to the land and thus help to determine which parts of the land shall yield grain and fruits, and
which parts shall remain barren deserts. Winds scatter the seeds of some kinds of plants, and also aid in the flight of birds, by lifting them somewhat as kites are lifted.</p>
<p>If it were not for currents of air there would be no sailing vessels nor windmills; but the winds are sometimes so strong that they wreck vessels and blow down trees and houses.</p>
<p>Under heavy clouds whirling winds over the sea sometimes form funnel-shaped spouts, which seem to descend and join the spray
raised from the waves. The long whirling funnels are called <hi rend="italic">waterspouts</hi>. They are seen most often over the oceans near the equator, but some of them form east of our country, over the warm parts of the ocean. The whirling winds of waterspouts are sometimes strong enough to dismast vessels.</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-030-d"><figDesc>General plan of the winds.  (The dotted areas indicate rain)</figDesc></figure>
<p>When the air is in motion all its parts are mixed and kept fresh and pure. Perhaps you can think of many other uses of winds.
Winds blow into the hot belt from the cooler belts on both sides. These winds bend to the westward, &mdash;those from the warm belt of the north bend towards the southwest; those from the warm belt of the south bend to the northwest.</p>
<p>These winds that blow westward in the hot belt are known as the <hi rend="italic">trade winds</hi>.</p>
<p>On the oceans they are steady and blow with little change by day or by night. Over the lands they are not so steady, as there are more changes in the heating of the surface. To the people living in the torrid zone these east winds are very refreshing.</p>
<p>Can you tell by the maps on page 31 what parts of the continents are in the path of the trade winds?</p>





<pb n="31" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-031" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
<p>As the trade winds flow into the hot belt, they become warmer and can hold more moisture. They do not give out rainfall unless they are chilled on the way. Some lowlands in the paths of these winds are therefore dry; but the windy sides of highlands in the path of the trade winds receive abundant rains.</p>
<p>When air rises to cross highlands it is cooled, and some of its vapor may then form clouds that
yield rainfall <note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-031-1"></note>  on the slopes of the highlands.</p>
<p>Some of the great deserts are lowlands on the lee side of mountains in the path of the trade winds.</p>
<p>Along the line of greatest heat, where the winds that enter the hot belt from both sides meet, there is a narrow belt where the winds are weak and often die away to a calm. Much vapor rises in this warm belt of calms, and rains pour down almost every
afternoon or evening. As this rainy belt is near the equator, it is called the <hi rend="italic">equatorial rain belt</hi>.</p>
<p>So much rain falls in this belt of calms that the surface of the ocean there is a little less salt than the ocean under the drying trade winds.</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-031-a"><figDesc>NOTE:&mdash;This map <note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-031-2"></note> shows the winds and rains of the northern winter.

<p>In the warm and the cool belts the winds vary in direction from time to time and often bring storms. They blow mostly from the west, in the opposite direction from the trade winds, and are therefore called <hi rend="italic">westerly winds</hi>,<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-031-3"></note> or <hi rend="italic">anti-trade winds</hi>.</p>
<p>The storms in these westerly winds carry rains to the highlands and the west coasts of the temperate zone, that is, to the warm and the cool belts. In these belts the winds also blow at times from the east or south or north, and so most of the slopes facing the sea on either side are well watered; but the regions far inland are often very dry.</p>

<p>Between the trade winds of the hot belt and the westerly winds of the warm and the cool belts there

<p><hi rend="bold">23. Ocean Currents</hi></p>
<p>If you blow on the surface of water in a cup or basin, little waves will spring up, and soon a current of water will be set in motion.</p>
<p> Winds blowing day after day for a long time against the waves in the sea cause the surface waters to drift
along and thus form <hi rend="italic">ocean currents</hi>. When they are rapid they are called <hi rend="italic">streams</hi>.</p>
<p>
In each ocean the currents move in the general direction of the winds over them. The trade winds blow ocean currents westward, and westerly winds blow others eastward.</p>
<p>What then is the general direction of ocean currents in the torrid zone? In the temperate zone?
</p>



<p>The lands prevent the ocean currents from moving round and round the earth, and require them to move in vast circles, or eddies, in the oceans.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-032-1"></note></p>
<p>Part of the water that flows across the Atlantic ocean, under the trade winds of the torrid zone, is turned to the northeast by the coast of North America. This current is rapid in some parts and is called the Gulf stream.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-032-2"></note></p>
<p>The Gulf stream carries much warm water far into the cold seas of the north. The westerly winds blowing along the surface of this water are warmed and carry warmth to the western parts of Europe.</p>
<p>We have learned that the oceans do not cool so quickly as the lands in winter, nor heat so quickly as the lands in summer. The
water keeps a more even, or steady, temperature than the land. Winds, therefore, blowing from the sea to the land help to keep
the temperature of such land even, without extreme heat or cold.</p>
<p>The trade winds help to refresh the eastern shores of the hot lands of the torrid zone. The westerly winds tend to make steady, or even, the climate of the western shores of the lands of the temperate zone. The good effect of these winds is felt far inland, where there are no mountains near the coasts.</p>

 <note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-032-1"><p>To TEACHERS:&mdash;The arrows on the map of ocean currents show how the waters drift along under the winds. The Atlantic and Pacific oceans have eddies both north and south of the equator, flowing west with the trade winds and east with the westerly winds.</p>
<p>The Indian ocean has a large eddy south of the equator, because the winds are quite steady there; but in this ocean north of the equator the winds blow half the year towards the south coast of Asia, and then the ocean current flows in the same direction. During the other half of the year the winds blow towards the east coast of Africa, and the ocean current turns and flows in the same direction.</p>
<p>The ocean eddies north of the equator move slowly in the direction in which the hands of a clock turn. South of the equator they move in the opposite direction, or against the hands of a clock. In the far south the oceans spread all
the way round the earth. There the waters drifting under the westerly winds move slowly towards the east and go all the way round the Antarctic ocean.</p>
<p>Teachers that wish to enter into the study of the monsoons and the changing ocean currents under these winds will find the maps on page 31 complete in all necessary details. The most marked change is, of course, in the Indian ocean.</p>

<note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-032-2">To TEACHERS: &mdash;For a long time this stream was thought to come from the gulf of Mexico, and hence was given the name Gulf stream. Now it is known that only part of the water flows from this gulf, and that even this part, with all the rest, is first drifted slowly across the Atlantic ocean by the trade winds of the torrid zone, and then turned aside by the land.

<p>In the hot belt of the New World, in South America, are also found millions of savages, but they belong to the <hi rend="italic">red</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Indian race</hi>. They have high cheek bones and straight black hair. Their slain is reddish-brown or copper color.</p>
<p>A little later we shall find that many white people live in parts of South America; but the people of the inland parts are mostly Indians.</p>
<p>Many tribes of Indians live in the dense forests along the Amazon river and its branches. In their home life these "red men" resemble the black savages of middle Africa. They wear but little clothing and use about the same kinds of weapons. They hunt and fish, and lead a lazy, shiftless life.</p>
<p>Many Indians live in the towns near the coast and also in the mountains. There they have seen how the white man lives and have become much more intelligent than the natives along the Amazon banks.</p>
<p>When the white men first came to America the Indians near lake Titicaca in the Andes, and also those in the highlands of Mexico, had temples and other buildings of stone. They made cloth and worked in copper and gold, but the use of iron was not known to them. They also built good roads and bridges. These people had made more progress than any others in the red race.</p>
<p>If we leave South America and travel northward along the highland in North America, we shall find millions of Indians, scattered all the way to the border of the United States. Within our country there are only about a quarter of a million people of the red race. There are some large tribes still further north, in Canada, but their number is small compared with that of the white people in the same country.
</p>
<p>In the highland of Mexico live to-day several million Indians, as well as millions of white people. The Indians are all much more intelligent than the savages of the Amazon valley, and many of them till the soil, tend cattle, work in the silver mines, attend school and live in houses, just as the white men there do.</p>
<p>Nearly all the Indians of our country live on large tracts of land which have been set apart as homes for the tribes. These tracts of land are called <hi rend="italic">reservations</hi>.</p>

<p>When Columbus came to America, lie thought he had reached a country called <hi rend="italic">India</hi>, in southern Asia. The natives here were therefore called <hi rend="italic">Indians</hi>.</p>
<p>The Indians of some tribes often painted their faces and their bodies in streaks of bright red, and the early white settlers in North America called them red men.<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-035-a"><figDesc>Huts of brown people in the Philippines islands.</figDesc></figure> The large animal is a buffalo The Indians spoke of the white men as <hi rend="italic">palefaces</hi>.</p>
<p>At one time the savage Indians hunted over nearly all parts of our country, but most of them were in the eastern half, where game was abundant and where corn could easily be raised. The women of the tribes planted gardens of corn, and the men spent time hunting deer, buffalo, or bison, and other animals.</p>
<p>The Indians taught the early white settlers how to make soft shoes of deerskin, and canoes of birch bark. From the savage the white man learned also how to make corn grow in a forest. Rings of bark were cut from the trunks of the trees, or the bark was burned off, so that the sap could not flow. The trees soon died, and being without leaves, the warm sunshine could ripen the grain.</p>
<p>It is thought that about as many Indians live here now as when the first white settlers came. About one third of them now live in houses of wood or brick. They own large herds of cattle, and raise fruit and grain. In some places they have good schools.</p>
<p>Some Indians still live in tents. The earlier tents were made of the skins of animals, but cloth is now generally used. Some build houses of large sun-dried brick, or adobe, and in many cases these houses are large enough for several families.</p>
<p>The native weapons are the bow and arrow and the hatchet, or  tomahawk. The Indian of former days shot the arrow and threw the tomahawk with great skill. Many are now skillful in the use of the rifle.</p>
<p>The red men had no horses before the white men came here from Europe, but many of the Indians are now excellent riders.</p>
<p>As the home of the Indians is in America, they are often called the American race.</p>
<p>Most of the Indians live in the torrid zone, where most of the Negroes also live. There are thought to be about twelve times as many Negroes as Indians in the world.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-035-c"><figDesc>Map of the races</figDesc></figure>
<p>The people of the brown or Malay race also live alma wholly in the torrid zone. The home is mainly on the islands
the East Indies, southeast also includes countless small islands that extend for thousands of miles eastward into
the Pacific ocean.One large group of islands, called the Philippines, lying southeast of Asia, belongs to the United States.
Several million people of the brown race live in these islands.</p>

<p>The people of the brown race have coarse black hair, flat faces and short skulls. Many of them have strong and well-built bodies. Their color is dark brown.</p>
<p>In some of the large islands southeast of Asia the brown people have towns and cities. In these islands much coffee and a very
large portion of all the spices used in the world are raised. The towns and cities are mainly seaports, from which the coffee, spices
and other products are sent abroad.<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-036-a"><figDesc>Brown men of the Fiji islands</figDesc></figure></p>

<p>Many people of the Malay race are yet savages; others till the soil; still others are traders and sailors. Some are famous for the skill with which they can paddle canoes, even going far out on the ocean, from island to island, in these frail crafts.</p>
<p>Far out in the middle of the Pacific ocean there is a group of islands, called the Hawaiian islands, belonging to our country. Many white men have gone there to trade and to raise sugar cane, but the natives of the islands belong to the brown race. Many of them work in the fields of cane.<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-036-f"><figDesc>Native hut, Hawaii</figDesc></figure></p>
<p>Among the islands peopled by the brown race, besides

<p>27. The Yellow Race</p>
<p>The home of the yellow race is in Asia, and includes the lands of China and Japan east of
peop1 of the yellow race have slanting eyes, coarse black hair, flat faces and short skulls. Except in the slant of the eyes they look very much like the people of the brown race.</p>
<p>It is thought by many persons that both the Malays and the Indians belong to the yellow race, but roamed away ages ago from the original home in Asia; the one race in some way reaching America, the other going off to the islands southeast of Asia. But at the present time they differ enough to treat them as three races.</p>
<p>Several hundred years ago the Chinese invented printing and gunpowder, but for many years that part of the yellow race has
made little progress. One fourth of all the people in the world live in China, yet that great country has only a few miles of rail
road. The Chinese know very little about machinery for weaving cloth or for making iron and steel goods. They have not yet learned the value of coal as a fuel, though there are coal beds in their country.Some of the largest cities in the world are in China. The Chinese belong to a very old nation. They could spin and weave fine silks long before the people of Europe knew how, and they have long known how to make paper and beautiful porcelain dishes, such as cups, saucers and plates. The Chinese also raise immense quantities of tea. </p>

any other branch of the race. They are eager to learn how the white men do all kinds of work, and they have been wise enough to adopt many of the customs of the white race.</p>
<p>The Japanese are a brave and active people. They have fine ships of war, as well as ships for trading. Like the Chinese they are famous for weaving of silk and the making of porcelain. The people of both these lands are very skillful in carving ivory.</p>
<p>Many tribes of yellow people live on the plains of Siberia. The small tribes are scattered along nearly the whole Arctic shore of
the Old World, &mdash; both in Asia and in Europe.</p>
<p>The people in some of these tribes in the cold lands live by fishing in the lakes and rivers. Others hunt in forests that lie far inland from the cold shores. Still others keep herds of reindeer, and these useful animals supply the people with skins for clothing, and milk and meat for food. The swift deer also drag the natives on sleds over the frozen surface.</p>
<p>Many white people from Europe have also moved to the wide plain in northern Asia, and there are now more white people than yellow people in that land; but most of the tribes of yellow people live farther north, nearer the Arctic shore.</p>
<p>Small tribes of yellow people, called Eskimos, live along the Arctic shores of America. There the summer is too short to ripen grain. Seals, deer, bears, fish and sea birds supply food, clothing, heat and light.</p>
<p>Most of the Eskimos live in rounded huts made of stones, skins or driftwood. They make clothing out of the skins of seals and bears and the feathers of sea fowl. Hunting parties often build huts out of blocks of snow. In winter all the huts are buried in snow.</p>
<p>The Eskimos look very much like the yellow people in the tribes that live near the Arctic shores of the Old World.
The yellow race includes more than one third of the people on the earth.There are four times as many people in the yellow race as in the black race.</p>
<p>One part of China is called <hi rend="italic">Mongolia</hi>, and the whole race is sometimes called the <hi rend="italic">Mongolian race</hi>.</p>

It includes the part of Africa north of the great desert; all Europe, except where small tribes of yellow people have gone in from Asia; and all the great lands of Asia west and south of the central highland. Most of the people of Australia belong to the white race; many people of this race live in the southern part of Africa.</p>

<p>It is thought that ages ago there lived somewhere in central Asia a race of white people, now known as <hi rend="italic">Aryans.</hi><note  target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-038-2"></note> As the race increased in size large bands roamed about in search of new homes, where they could find pastures for their cattle. Many of the people went into India, where their descendants are still found.  Other bands drove their herds westward and settled in grassy valleys as far as the border of Europe. Finally tribee after tribe moved into the peninsulas of southern Europe, and these tribes have grown to be nations. Many other tribes moved into the other parts of Europe, and they too have grown to be great nations.</p>
<p>From Europe the white people have spread to America, Australia and southern Africa.</p>
<p>Another branch of the white race, though not the Aryan, has settled in southwest Asia and in the lands of Africa north of the Sahara, and also in the fertile places in the desert itself. These people are darker than the Aryans, but belong to the white race. They are called <hi rend="italic">Semites.</hi></p>
<p>In later lessons we shall learn much more about countries which the Aryans and the Semites have settled. The Semites gave us our alphabet and our system of common figures.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">29. Religions</hi></p>
<p>People that worship idols, or objects such as the sun, fire, animals or images, are called <hi rend="italic">pagans</hi>. As a rule, they believe that there are spirits having magical power to do good or evil.</p>
<p> Nearly all savages are pagans.  Most of them belong to the red race in the interior of South America; the black race in middle Africa; the black race in Australia and the great island of New Guinea on the north; the brown savages in parts of the islands southeast of Asia and in the islands far out in the Pacific; many of the tribes of yellow people along the Arctic coast. It will thus be seen that the pagans are the savages living mostly in the torrid zone, but in part in the frozen lands of the far north. About one seventh of all the people in the world are <hi rend="italic">pagans</hi>.</p>
<p>In the last lesson we learned that one branch of the Aryan people settled in the great peninsulas of southern Asia. Some of these went into the wedge-shaped peninsula of India, just south of the highest mountains of Asia.

<p>The native people of India are called <hi rend="italic">Hindus</hi>. A large part of them believe in a very old religion that divides the people into classes, called <hi rend="italic">castes</hi>. The four principal castes are the priests, the soldiers and rulers, the merchants and the servants. Below these are the outcasts.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Brahma</hi> is one of the chief gods in this religion, and the believers are called <hi rend="italic">Brahmanists</hi>. About one fifth of the people in the world live in India, and one half of them are Brahamanists.</p>

<p>Many years ago a prince of India outgrew the old religion and taught that the belief in castes should not form part of any religion. This prince did not believe in any of the gods. His name was <hi rend="italic">Buddha</hi>, and his followers are called <hi rend="italic">Buddhists</hi>.</p>
<p>The people of India did not long follow the teachings of Buddha, but his religion spread over central and eastern Asia. Most of the yellow race, or about one third of the people in the world, are now Buddhists.  One of the pictures on the next page shows a pagoda, or tower for religious purposes, built by the Chinese. Many Chinese are Buddhists.</p>
<p>The branch of the white race, known as <hi rend="italic">Semites</hi>, that live in southwest Asia and northern Africa, has given to the world the three great religions whose followers worship one God.</p>
<p>The Christians believe in one God and the Bible; the Jewish people believe in one God, but not in the part of the Bible called the <hi rend="italic">New Testament</hi>; the Mohammedans believe in one God, but their sacred book is the Koran. The  Christians are mostly descendants of the Aryans who settled in Europe. The Christian lands include the greater part of America, Europe and Australia and also the many European settlements along nearly all of the coast lands of the world. About one fourth of the people of the earth live in Christian countries.</p> 
<p>Two Christian churches are shown on the next page, &mdash; one a common form of wooden church with tall steeple; the other a beautiful church of stone.</p>
<p>Mohammed, the founder of the religion that bears his name, lived in the peninsula of Arabia, in south-west Asia, about a thousand years before the first English people settled in America.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">31. Where Plants Grow</hi></p>
<p>Man cannot produce plants in every place where their seeds may be sown, but only where the soil, heat and moisture are suited to their growth.</p>


<p>Meadow grass thrives in rich moist soil, but thistles often spring up in sandy or rocky places. Clover seeks the warm sunshine, while ferns grow best in shady woods. Some mosses cling to the hard surfaces of rocks, but water lilies take root in the soft mud at the bottom of ponds. Many trees thrive in swamps, others on dry hillsides.</p>


<p>Seeds of swamp plants may be blown to dry sandy fields, but there they will die. If thistle seeds blow into swamps, they perish. Some kinds of rice must be sown in fields that can be flooded but many cactus plants thrive in deserts.</p>

<p>Every kind of plant grows to suit its native haunts. By its roots, its stem, its leaves, its blossoms, it is fitted to get its food and ripen its seed.</p>

<p>The stem of the water lily grows long enough to reach from the mud to the surface of the water, where the seeds may ripen in the sun and air. Other stems bring the leaves of the same plant to the air, where they get much of their food.</p>


<p>Some grasses send their roots many feet into the ground in search of water, but the same grasses may put forth only short roots if the water is near the surface.</p>
	

<p>The seeds of the pine tree grow buried between the layers of the cones. These are often coated with pitch, to prevent the frost and rains from killing the seeds; but when the time comes for the seeds to grow into new plants the cones open and let them fall.</p>


<p>Plants have enemies, but they also have means of defending themselves against some of the enemies.</p>


<p>Thus worms and bugs destroy potatoes, tomatoes and other vegetables; caterpillars often swarm in apple trees, eating the leaves and sometimes killing the trees. Birds destroy many seeds, using them for food, just as man does. In defense, the thorns on roses often prevent animals from breaking the stems or eating the branches. Some plants protect themselves by secreting poison juices; some by bitter sap; some by sending out to their surfaces silky gums.</p>


<p>In deserts, where plants are few, many kinds of cactus are covered with long spines, or thorns, and these prevent most animals from eating the plants.</p>


<p>Many plants by means of their seeds or roots or stems, can spread over wide areas.</p>


<p>The light tufts of the thistle seed sometimes enable it to travel for miles in strong winds, and then fall in some place far from the parent plant.</p>


<p>Pine cones falling on hillsides may in time spread the seeds and cover the slopes with trees.</p>


<p>The branches of quick grass may creep for many feet through the soil, sending up green blades here and there.</p>


<p>Little animals, like field mice and squirrels, often carry corn, nuts and grasses to their nests, thus scattering seeds for plants in new places.</p>


<p>There are bounds in nature which plants cannot pass and live.</p>


<p>The seeds of water plants die if they fall on dry land, and the seeds of land plants die if they remain in water.</p>

<pb n="43" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-043" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />

<p>When the creeping branches of strong quick grass reach a pond or ledge, they must turn back or die. Meadow grasses cannot spread across hot sandy plains.</p>


<p>Plants that need strong sunshine may spread into colder and colder lands, but at last they reach a limit so cold that their seeds will not ripen even if the plants begin to grow. This is true of corn, which is easily killed by early frosts.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-043-a" place="upper middle of the page"></figure>

<p>Tender plants of the lowlands cannot grow on high mountains; and there are many plants growing on high slopes that would die if taken into the valleys.
</p>

<p>Some plants need a longer hot season than others, to ripen their seeds.
</p>

<p>Orange blossoms often cover the trees in early spring, while the branches are still loaded with golden fruit from the last year's blossoms, showing that the trees need about the whole year to ripen the seeds in the fruit. But the apple tree blooms in the springtime, and its fruit ripens before winter.
</p>

<p>Bananas require hot or warm weather all the year; far north, where snow covers the ground except for a few summer, millions of poppies find time to ripen their seed.</p>
<p>A plant is not found in all places where the soil, heat and moisture are suited to its growth; but if the plant is not native to such a place, its seeds or the plant itself will thrive if taken there.
</p>
<p>When white people first settled in America, they found here no wheat nor cotton. After a time the seeds were brought across the ocean, now these plants are among the most valuable in the New World. Most of the grains and fruits that grow in America are native to the Old World.</p>
	

<p>The sunshine not only divides the earth into belts of heat, but it enables only certain plants to grow in each belt.</p>


<p>Thus, many palms grow in the torrid zone. Cotton thrives in the warm belt. The cool belt is the home of the conebearing trees. The only trees of the frozen region of the far north are tiny dwarf willows.</p>


<p>But the same kind of plants cannot grow in all parts of a heat belt, because the lands there are not all alike. There are mountains and valleys, wet meadows and dry deserts, plains of clayey soil and others of sandy soil; but above all, there are broad seas and high mountains and wide deserts which act as barriers to the distribution of the seeds or of the plants themselves.</p>


<p>The plants and animals that are of greatest use to man have in many cases been carried to lands far from their native haunts. This is especially true of the most useful cultivated plants, such as wheat, corn, rice, cotton, coffee: man has carried the seeds across oceans, deserts and mountains and planted them in new regions, where they now thrive even better than in their original homes.</p>


<p>In this way the most useful plants have been distributed throughout the <hi rend="italic">heat belts</hi>, but in such parts of these belts as are suited to the habits of the various plants. As regards plants, therefore, we may study them best from the standpoint of zones or heat belts.</p>


<p>Man has also helped greatly to change the homes of the domestic animals, such as cattle, horses, sheep, hogs, common fowl; but in the case of most kinds of large and interesting <hi rend="italic">wild</hi> animals, man has done little to distribute them over the earth. For this reason, the <hi rend="italic">wild</hi> animals can best be studied in groups according to their natural regions of growth. It is well also to keep in mind the fact that the <hi rend="italic">wild</hi> plants also are often studied in groups in the same natural regions. The lower map on this page shows the boundaries of these regions. Perhaps you can name the oceans, highlands and deserts that form these boundaries.</p>


<p><hi rend="bold">Helps:</hi> &mdash; Give some examples showing how plants are related to soil, moisture and heat; showing how stems, roots and seeds are fitted to natural home of the plants; showing that plants have enemies; showing how some plants can defend themselves; showing how plants spread about; showing that there are bounds that plants cannot pass; showing that plants need different

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-044-a" place="Diagonally from left to right"></figure>

<p>REVIEW:&mdash; Between what lines is the torrid zone? What continents are crossed by the equator? By the tropic of Cancer? By the tropic of Capricorn? State which portion of each continent is in the torrid zone.</p>

<p>The plants useful to man are almost countless. Some produce foods, others medicine, others fibers for making cloth, others lumber for houses and furniture, others dyes for coloring cloth, others wood  for fuel, others spices to season foods.</p>

<p>The following will serve as examples to show the uses of plants For <hi rend="italic">food</hi>, rice and wheat; for <hi rend="italic">luxuries</hi>, tea and cloves; for <hi rend="italic">clothing</hi>, cotton and flax; for <hi rend="italic">lumber</hi>, pine and oak; for <hi rend="italic">fuel</hi>, pine and maple for <hi rend="italic">medicine</hi>, poppy (yielding opium) and cinchona (yielding quinine); for <hi rend="italic">manufactures</hi>, walnut and mahogany. Can you add at least one more to each group?</p>

<p>Man uses many parts of plants to supply his needs. Can you tell what uses are made of the parts of plants here given? &mdash; Of the <hi rend="italic">trunks</hi>, ebony and pine; of <hi rend="italic">leaves</hi>, tea and tobacco; of <hi rend="italic">roots</hi>, potato and sassafras; of <hi rend="italic">bark</hi>, white birch (used by Indians) and cinnamon; of <hi rend="italic">seeds</hi>, corn and oats; of <hi rend="italic">sap</hi>, sugar cane and India rubber; of <hi rend="italic">fruits</hi>, grape and orange; of <hi rend="italic">buds</hi>, clove and poppy; of <hi rend="italic">fibers</hi>, cotton and hemp. Perhaps you can add another plant to each of these groups.
</p>
<p>The vegetation of the torrid zone is luxuriant. There are dense forests, often filled with long trailing vines; there are myriads of flowers, and abundant fruits. The natives of that zone obtain their food and simple clothing without much work, and most of them lead a lazy, shiftless life.
</p>

<p>The temperate zones yield abundant harvests of grain, and crops of fruits and vegetables. In the cooler half of these zones severe winters have taught men to labor and to save during the warmer seasons. Work is man's best teacher, and in the temperate zones are found the most enlightened nations of the earth.
</p>

<p>The north frigid zone is too cold for common food plants. The Eskimos and other tribes of yellow people in that dreary region live on flesh and fat. There is but little variety in their daily work, and as a rule the yellow people within the Arctic circle (except in a small part of northern Europe) are very ignorant.
</p>

<p>In the torrid zone various <hi rend="italic">palms</hi> are among the most useful plants. This part of the earth is often called the <hi rend="italic">zone of palms</hi>.
</p>

<p>Among these is the valuable cocoa palm. It thrives best in hot lands near the sea, but
is also found far inland. From the wood of its trunk many useful articles are made
by the natives of the hot zone. They also weave the fibers of its long leaves into rope, cloth, mats and baskets. They use the nuts for food, and make dishes out of the hard shells.</p>

<p>Some kinds of palm trees produce dates. These are the chief article of food of many tribes in deserts. Many dates are dried, pressed and shipped to our own country, as well as others. Many date trees grow around springs that cause fertile spots, or <hi rend="italic">oases</hi>, in deserts.
</p>

<p>Other kinds of palms yield wax, oil, sago, wine and many other useful articles.
</p>

<p>Wax forms as a coating on the leaves of some kinds of palms. When the leaves are dried the wax is easily scraped off. It is used chiefly in making candles.
</p>

<p>Palm oil comes from the seeds of certain kinds of palm trees. The seeds are crushed and then boiled or melted down, and thus made to yield a valuable oil. It is used in making candles, glycerine and lubricating oil.
</p>

<p>Sago is palm starch. Can you tell what it is used for? The starch grows in cells in the tender inside portion of the palm trunks. It is generally sold in the form of tiny grains of sago.
</p>

<p>Palm wine is made from the sugary sap of various kinds of palm trees. It is used chiefly by the people of the tropical parts of Asia and Africa.
</p>

<p>Rattan also is a palm product. This is useful in making furniture. It is the long and slender stalk or stein of various species of flexible palms.
</p>

<p>Among the chief articles of food of people in the hot belt are bananas and plantains.
</p>

<p>Bananas and plantains are almost alike, the latter being slightly coarser. The banana plant is treelike in size, but has a soft stalk, with very long leaves. Often the plant is twenty feet high, and the fruit hangs in large clusters. The breadfruit tree thrives in many parts of the hot zone.</p>
 

<p>The fruit of this tree grows to about the size of a child's head. The breadfruit is often baked and sometimes it is ground to flour. On many islands in the Pacific, bananas and breadfruit are almost the only vegetable food of the natives, but the shore waters of some of the islands yield fish.
</p>

<p>Various parts of the torrid zone, especially the islands southeast of Asia, are rich in spices. Many have been transplanted far from the places where they were first raised, but most spices require a hot climate and plentiful rainfall.</p>

<p>Many different plants or parts of plants are used as spices, such as the seeds of vanilla, the bark of cinnamon, the rootstock of ginger, the berries of pepper, the buds of cloves. The spicy quality in most of them depends on the kind of oil they contain.</p>

<p>One of the pictures on the next page, and also part of the picture on this page, shows some of the most common spices used in cooking.</p>

<p>The sweet-scented kernels of nutmeg are taken from a small fruit that grows on a large tree. After the tree once begins to bear fruit it is always covered with both fruit and flowers, and yields two or three crops a year. The seed of the fruit
is dried, then cracked open, and the hard round kernel taken out. This is the <hi rend="italic">nutmeg</hi> of commerce. The inside covering of the kernel supplies the spice galled <hi rend="italic">mace</hi>.</p>

<p>Another tree yields the biting flower buds  of the clove. The word <hi rend="italic">clove</hi> <hi rend="italic">nail</hi>, and the name was given because of the resemblance in form. When the flower buds turn red they are gathered and spread out to dry and turn brown in the sun. They are then ready for market.</p>

<p>Cloves are native to the islands southeast of Asia, but have been transplanted to nearly all tropical parts of the world. Many are raised in Brazil. They are not only widely used as spice, but a valuable oil is extracted from them.</p>


<p>Fragrant cinnamon is the dried bark of a tree. Only the inner bark, which remains after stripping off the outer layer, is dried for market. The spice is raised chiefly in the island of Ceylon, near the coast of India, and in China. The 
flavor of the spice varies greatly with the soil and the climate in which it is raised. The pleasing odor of this spice, and of nearly all other spices, comes from the oil which they contain. The fruit of the vanilla plant, from which the 
well-known flavoring extract is made, grows in the form of long pods containing many small black seeds.</p>

  


  
  
	
 

 
 


<pb n="46" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-046" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />

<p>Ginger is made from the rootstock of plants growing in the hot belt. Sometimes the dried rootstock is ground to powder and sold in this form.
</p>

<p>The stinging powder called <hi rend="italic">pepper</hi> is made from berries that grow in long clusters on climbing shrubs or vines.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-046-a" place="upper middle of the page"><figDesc>Tea farm in China</figDesc></figure>

<p>The torrid zone supplies the world with coffee. Most of the coffee used in our country grows in the eastern part of South America, near the tropic of Capricorn; but a large part of the coffee used in all countries is raised in the great peninsulas of southern Asia and the East Indies, southeast of Asia. The coffee plant thrives best in warm weather, with plenty of rainfall.
</p>

<p>The plant produces berries that look like cherries. The berries are picked when they turn dark red and begin to shrivel. Each berry has two seeds, and these are taken out by machines. The seeds of the coffee berries are sent to market, but before being used to flavor drinks they are roasted and ground.</p>

<p>Tea is another plant used to flavor drink. This useful plant grows best in a hot, moist and even climate, like that of southeast China, India and the islands southeast of Asia.</p>


<p>Several times a year crops of tea leaves are picked for curing. Care is taken to nip off the leaves without injuring the buds which grow where the leaves join the branches. The youngest and earliest leaves are the most delicate and produce the best flavor.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-046-b" place="lower left of the page"><figDesc>Scenes in Brazil</figDesc></figure>

<p>The green leaves which are to be cured and sold as black tea are first spread on 
trays to dry. The leaves are then roasted for a few minutes and afterwards rolled 
between the hands to press out the juices. As the leaves dry they turn black, and are then ready for use. The green and the black teas are made from the same kind of leaves, but for the green tea the process of drying is completed as rapidly as possible after picking.</p>

<p>About four pounds of fresh leaves are needed to make each pound of tea.</p>

<p>One of the principal foods of people living in the hot belt and in some parts of the warm lands farther north is rice. For ages it has been a leading food crop in China, Japan, India and the islands southeast of Asia. Smaller crops are raised in other warm parts of the earth, for example, in the southern part of our own country.</p>


<p>The pretty white grain called <hi rend="italic">rice</hi> is raised both in lowland and in upland regions, but the best rice grows on lands that can be flooded. One plan is to lay out the field in little furrows in which the seed is sown. The water is then let in and stands till the seed sprouts. The water may then be drained off, but when points form on the stalks the fields are again flooded, and the grain ripens standing in water, as shown in the smallest picture on the opposite page.</p>


<p>When the rice is ripe it is cut and the grain is threshed from it. This is one of the most useful plants that grow on the earth.
</p>

<p>Sugar cane grows	in nearly all parts of the torrid zone and in some of the warmer parts of the temperate. Among the regions richest in sugar cane are the islands in the tropical seas extending from North to South America, especially Cuba, the largest of all these islands. Sugar cane needs rich soil and a hot even climate, with plenty of rainfall.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-046-c" place="lower rightt of the page"><figDesc>Spices of the East Indies</figDesc></figure>

<p>One of the pictures on the opposite page shows how sugar cane appears growing in the soil. When cut the cane is taken to mills, where the stalks are ground between iron rollers to extract the juice. This is boiled several times to make it thicker and thus sweeter, and at last the sugar forms as brown crystals in the vats. This is the brown sugar of commerce. The dark liquid taken from the vats is molasses.
</p>

<p>The brown sugar may be purified, or refined, in various ways, but the principle of the process is to dissolve it in water and let

<pb n="47" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-047" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />

it slowly filter through layers of bone charcoal or other porous substance, which takes out the impurities. The liquid is then boiled till it thickens and the whiter sugar again forms as crystals, leaving a part still as liquid syrup. In some countries the same plants will grow for several years, being cut once a year.</p>


<p>Among the other important plants growing in the torrid zone, and also in the warmer parts of the temperate zone, are cotton and tobacco.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-047-a" place="upper middle of the page"><figDesc>Bamboo</figDesc></figure>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-047-b" place="upper middle of the page"><figDesc>Banyan Tree</figDesc></figure>

<p>Another product very useful to the natives of the hot and warm belts, especially of the Old World, is bamboo.</p>
	

<p>This is a coarse grasslike plant often growing to the height of from fifty to seventy feet. The tender shoots of young may be used for food. The softer parts of some stalks are beaten into pulp and are used in making paper. Strips of bamboo are made into baskets, chairs, beds and very many other articles. Even houses or huts are in part made of the strong jointed stems.
</p>

<p>Many of the trees of the torrid zone are very useful Some yield valuable lumber; others, beautiful dyes; others, gums used for various purposes, such as making varnishes; still others, fine cabinet woods, or woods used for making furniture. Many yield fruits and spices.</p>
 
<p>Among the curious trees of the hot belt is the banyan. Its  branches send down shoots that take root in the ground. These shoots also branch, and the new branches send down other shoots. A single tree may thus grow to form a grove covering several acres.</p>

<p>One of the most useful gum trees in the India rubber tree. There are various species of this tree. Many are found on the hot and damp banks of the Amazon river. To get the asp from some trees, deep cuts are made in the ark, and cups are placed beneath them to catch the milky sap that oozes out. When heated in certain kinds of smoke, this juice dries, thickens and forms rubber of a fine quality.</p>

<p>From another kind of tree the outer layer of bark is stripped off to the height of about five feet from the ground. The sap then runs out and hardens on the trunk of the tree. After a few days this rubber sap is ready for market.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-047-c" place="lower left of the page"><figDesc>Cutting sugar cane</figDesc></figure>

<p>India rubber is made from the sap of many kinds of trees and shrubs that grow in nearly all hot and damp parts of the earth. Name some of the uses of rubber.</p>


<p>Among the many species of trees yielding dyes may be named <hi rend="italic">logwood</hi>. Thin chips are cut from the trees and are kept moist. Green crystals form on the chips, and these crystals are used in dyeing cloth.</p>


<p>Dyes of various kinds are made from logwood. Some of these are used to give the color in blue woolen cloth, purple calico and black prints.</p>

<p>The vegetation the torrid zone far surpasses in variety and density that of any other part of the earth. In places the trees grow in dense masses,	with long vines weaving networks among the branches. In many parts of the lowlands the thick foliage shuts out the drying sunshine. The rainfall being heavy, these lands become very wet and therefore unhealthful for white people.</p>

<p>Both in the forests and in the open fields of the torrid zone grow many plants of rich color and beautiful form, such as we sometimes see in hothouses.</p>

<p>REVIEW:&mdash;What line runs along the south side of the northern warm belt? Which portion of the United States is in this belt? Which portion of Europe? Of Africa? Of Asia?</p>
 

<p>What part of South America is in the southern warm belt? Of Africa? Of Australia?
</p>

<p>Many of the plants of the torrid zone thrive also in parts of the warm belts, especially rice, tea, sugar cane, bamboo and many fruits.
</p>


<p>Cotton requires a very long warm season with plentiful rainfall to ripen its seeds and thus produce long fibers on

<pb n="48" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-048" rend="Arabic" place="lower left" />

them. This plant grows therefore in warm and hot lands. The northern warm belt is often called the <hi rend="italic">cotton belt</hi> of the world. This plant also grows well in parts of the torrid zone, such as India. The most productive cotton regions are the warm plains in the southern part of our own country, the peninsula of India and the Nile valley in northeast Africa.</p>

<p>The value of this plant is shown by the fact that about one half the people of the earth wear clothing made wholly of cotton; and nearly all the rest of the human race, except some savage tribes, use it in some part of their dress.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-048-a" place="upper middle of the page"><figDesc>Picking cotton</figDesc></figure>

<p>The best grade of cotton has long strong fibers and grows on low sandy islands along the southeast coast of our country.</p>

<p>Until about a century ago cotton fiber was separated by hand from the seeds. This was very slow work, for a person could pick only about a pound of fiber in a day. The price of cotton was therefore so high that poor people could not afford to use much cotton cloth.</p>

<p>At length a machine was made to separate the fiber from the seeds. This machine was called the <hi rend="italic">cotton engine, &mdash;</hi> now shortened to <hi rend="italic">cotton gin</hi>. It has fine sawteeth that draw the fibers through slits too narrow to let the seeds pass. A large cotton gin can thus clean about fifteen or twenty bales of cotton in a day. A bale weighs, on an average, about 500 pounds. Of course cotton soon became much cheaper, and its use in clothing increased.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-048-b" place="middle of the page"><figDesc>Cotton gin and cotton plant</figDesc></figure>

<p>One of the pictures, in the form of a diagram, on this pale shows how a cotton gin does its work. The cotton, as it comes from the field, is put into the opening at the top; it falls upon the saw-teeth of the turning wheels and is carried to the narrow slits. There the fiber is drawn from the seeds and is carried through the slits. Wheels having strong brushes clean the fiber from the saw-teeth and brush it along and out of the cotton gin. It is then carried to powerful presses and made into bales. It is now ready for market and is the <hi rend="italic">raw cotton</hi> from which thread and cloth are made.</p>

<p>Before the cotton gin was invented machines had been made for spinning or twisting fibers into thread and for weaving the thread into cloth. There was a large and growing demand for raw cotton, and the cotton gin made it possible to supply this fiber without great expense.</p>

<p>One of the pictures on this page shows a room in which thousands of spindles are twisting cotton fibers into thread and winding the thread up in the form of large spools. Before reaching this room the fibers have been combed, or <hi rend="italic">carded</hi>, so as to unsnarl them and put them in order for twisting into thread.</p>

<p>The lower picture shows great looms at work weaving threads across one another, so as to make cloth.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-048-c" place="lower middle of the page"><figDesc>Looms for weaving cloth</figDesc></figure>

<p>When the fibers are drawn away through the slits the seeds roll back and fall out of the machine through an opening marked in the diagram. They are then carried to a strong press which squeezes the oil out of them. This is known as <hi rend="italic">cotton-seed oil</hi>. It is used in making soap and other articles. Much of the oil is refined and sold under the name of <hi rend="italic">olive oil</hi>, but the real olive oil is made from the olive fruit.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">oil cake</hi> which remains after the oil is pressed from cotton Seeds is used to fatten many thousand cattle every year. With all these uses it is clear that cotton is one of the most useful plants cultivated by man.</p>

<p>Tobacco plants thrive both in the torrid and the temperate zones. More tobacco is raised in the United States than in any other country, but the best grade of tobacco comes from Cuba. Europe, southern Asia and the islands southeast of Asia produce large quantities.</p>

<p>Tobacco consists of the dried or <hi rend="italic">cured</hi> leaves of several species of plants. Some of these grow to the height of six feet or more and bear large coarse leaves on their simple upright stalks.</p>

<p>When the leaves are old enough the tall stalks bearing the leaves are cut off close to the ground. In some places the plants are then hung on long rods in the fields to dry; in other places the drying takes place in the curing houses.</p>

<p>After a time the leaves are stripped from the stalks and are bound in small bundles. Sometimes these are placed in heaps on the floor to heat slowly till certain changes take

place in the leaves. They are then ready to be made into cigars, snuff or other tobacco goods.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-049-a" place="upper middle of the page"><figDesc>Curing tobacco in the field</figDesc></figure>

<p>The warmer half of the temperate zone is rich in such fruits as oranges, lemons, figs, grapes, peaches and pineapples.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-049-b" place="upper middle of the page"><figDesc>Tobacco farm</figDesc></figure>

<p>Most kinds of orange and lemon trees are killed by heavy frosts, and the culture of this fruit is therefore most successful in warm lands, in the warm and the hot belts of the earth.</p>

<p>Figs thrive in the same climate as oranges. Before being sent to market most figs are dried and pressed.</p>

<p>Grapes are widespread over the torrid and temperate zones. There are many varieties, some being marketed for eating fresh from the vines, some being sent to the presses to yield their juice for wines and others being spread in the strong sunshine to dry and become raisins. In some parts of southern Europe tiny grapes are dried and sold under the name of <hi rend="italic">dried currants</hi>.</p>


<p>The pineapple takes its name from the fact that the fruit looks like a great cone from a pine tree.</p>

<p>The lowland regions in the warmer half of the temperate zone produce many kinds of useful grains, such as wheat, corn and rice.</p>

<p>Rice was described in the last lesson; wheat and corn will be considered more fully in the next lesson, as they thrive chiefly in the cooler half of the temperate zones, on both sides of the equator.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-049-e" place="right middle of the page"><figDesc>California vineyard</figDesc></figure>

<p>Valuable forests cover large parts of the warm belt of the north. Here are found such hard-wood trees as maple, oak, hickory arid also the useful long-leaf or yellow pine. These forests yield large quantities of lumber.</p>


<p>The yellow pine sends up large straight trunks with wood made of very strong fibers. Such trunks make excellent masts and spars for ships, as well as lumber for buildings.</p>


<p>In the spring many of these trees are <hi rend="italic">hacked</hi> or gashed and boxes are cut in the trunks. The sap which gathers in these boxes is called <hi rend="italic">raw turpentine</hi>. This is put in large vats, or <hi rend="italic">stills</hi>, and boiled; the vapor that rises and passes into another vessel, where it cools, is called <hi rend="italic">spirits of turpentine</hi>. This is very useful in many ways, as in mixing paints.</p>


<p>The part that does not pass off as turpentine is known as <hi rend="italic">rosin</hi>. It is poured into barrels, where it cools and hardens and is ready for market.</p>


<p>When the wood is burned slowly with little air, buried under turf, <hi rend="italic">tar</hi> runs out and is collected in vats or barrels. When the tar is boiled till it thickens somewhat, it forms <hi rend="italic">pitch</hi>.</p>


<p>Rosin is widely used in varnishes, soaps, paper and various oils. Rosin, tar, pitch and turpentine are called <hi rend="italic">naval stores</hi> and are of great use in the process of building and rigging ships, as in making the decks and other parts of the hull water-tight, and in preserving the ropes from the action of rains, damp air and sea water.</p>

<p>The warmer half of each temperate zone lies between the trade winds of the torrid zone and the westerly winds of the cooler parts of the temperate zones. Some parts of the warm belts are in the path of moist winds from border seas, but other parts receive but little rainfall.</p>




<pb n="50" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-050" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />


<p>In many parts of the warm belts and in some parts of the cool belts there are wet seasons followed by months of drouth. In such regions the rains or melted snows of neighboring uplands or mountains are often gathered into reservoirs for use during the dry season. Canals or ditches from these reservoirs lead the water into groves, vineyards and vegetable gardens.</p>


<p>If it were not for this water supply, some of the most fertile and fruitful regions of the temperate zones would be very dry, at least in some seasons. The process of storing up water and then leading it in ditches over the land is called <hi rend="italic">irrigation</hi>.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-050-a" place="upper middle of the page"></figure>

<p>In some of the drier parts of the warm belts are found many species of <hi rend="italic">cactus</hi>. Many of these plants have leafless steals with large thorns.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">34. Plants of the Cool Temperate Zone
</hi></p>

<p>The cool belt of the south has so little land and so few useful products that we need hardly mention it. By the term <hi rend="italic">cool belt</hi>, in this lesson, will therefore be meant the cool belt of the north.</p>


<p>What line separates this cool belt from the north frigid zone? How far south does the cool belt extend in North America? In Europe? In Asia?</p>

<p>Describe the seasons of the lands in cool belt of the north. <hi rend="italic">See lesson 21</hi>. What winds blow chiefly in the cool belt? <hi rend="italic">See lesson ,22</hi>. </p>

<p>The broad cooler portion of the north temperate zone is rightly called the <hi rend="italic">grain belt</hi>. It produces most of the wheat, corn, rye, oats and barley used in the world.</p>

<p>The wheat seed consists of a grain inside a thin husk. The inner part of the grain is used in making fine white flour, but the entire grain makes wholesome though darker flour.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of wheat. Some thrive in scanty soil; others, in deep rich soil. Sonic grow best in hot lands; others, in cooler climates. For these reasons, wheat is a widespread grain.</p>

<p>Wheat is hardier than by corn, not being so easily injured by frost or by cool weather. The cooler plains of the temperate zone therefore yield more wheat; the warmer plains, more corn.</p>

<p>Corn meal is widely used in cooking, and is a healthful and nutritious food. When the grain, or kernel, is broken, hulled and boiled, it is called <hi rend="italic">hominy</hi>. Green corn, or <hi rend="italic">sweet corn</hi>, is often boiled on the cob and is thus used for food. A large amount of green corn is canned for market. Great quantities of corn are used to fatten hogs and cattle.</p>


<p>Rye, oats and barley are much hardier than corn, and often thrive in poorer soil and a colder climate; but they thrive also in the fertile and warmer plains far south.</p>


<p>In some parts of the great Central plain of our country the grainfields are so large that engines are used to plow the ground, cut the grain, bind and thresh it.</p>


<p>Many kinds of fine fruits grow in most parts of the cool belt. Among these are apples, pears, peaches, grapes, apricots and plums. The cool belt, and also parts of the warm belts, produce many vegetables, such as potatoes, beans, peas, cabbages, onions and turnips. The various kinds of grains and vegetables, with meats, form the chief articles of food of the people in the temperate zones.</p>


<p>Tobacco is an important product of the cool belt, as well as of warmer regions of the earth.</p>

 

<pb n="51" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-051" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
<p>The cooler part of the north temperate zone is sometimes called the <hi rend="italic">pine forest belt</hi>, but there are also many hard-wood trees.
</p>
<p>The pine, fir, spruce, hemlock and other trees form a group of valuable soft-wood trees. Some of the trunks make tall, straight <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-051-a" place="above middle of left column of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Some products of the north temperate zone. How many can you name?</hi></figDesc></figure>and strong masts for ships. Soft-wood lumber is used in making parts of furniture and buildings. Much of the wood of the spruce is ground to pulp, and this is used in making some kinds of paper.
</p>
<p>In the autumn bands of lumbermen go into the forests of the north, locate camps, lay out roads, clear the channels of streams and thus make ready for the work of getting out logs or timber. All through the winter trees are felled and then chopped or sawed into logs of proper length for handling. These are hauled to the banks of the streams and there piled up, often on the ice, to await the time of the spring thawing. Then when melting snow and rains swell the streams and they are free from ice, the logs are floated down to the mills and there sawed into lumber, such as boards, beams, planks and shingles.
</p>
<p>One of the pictures shows a lumber camp in a snowy forest. The picture above it shows a river filled with logs; on the farther bank of the river is a sawmill at work sawing logs into lumber.

<p>One of the most useful products of the cool belt is <hi rend="italic">grass</hi>. The best grass lands in the world are there, and the grass supports millions of cattle, sheep and horses.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-051-c" place="about middle of left column of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Lumber camp in winter</hi></figDesc></figure>
<p>Flax is the principal fiber plant of the cool belt. From the strong fine fibers of this little plant are made linen thread and various kinds of linen cloth and lace.
</p>
<p>Linen cloth and thread are made from the silky fibers that form an inner bark round the stalk of the flax plant. Linseed oil is pressed from flaxseed. This oil is largely used in paints.
</p>
<p>Hemp is a useful fiber plant of this zone. It is used in making rope.
</p>
<p>The northern part of the temperate zone, near the Arctic circle, is very cold and dreary. There the seasons are too short to ripen grain. In most places the ground is frozen nearly all the year to a great depth and thaws only a few inches at the surface during the few weeks of summer. The trees dwindle away and almost disappear.
</p>
<p>Few people live in this part of the temperate zone.

<p>The dreary plains in the extreme northern part of the temperate zone, with only a few trees of pine, spruce, birch, willow and other hardy trees, merge into the still colder lands within the Arctic circle, where the great tree family dies away in dwarf birches and willows, only a few inches in height. There in the frozen marshes or <hi rend="italic">tundras </hi>are also found mosses, lichens and stunted shrubs.

<p>During the few weeks of summer, when a thin layer of surface soil thaws, nature seems to wake quickly and some of the fields become bright with poppies and other flowers.
</p>
<p>On some of the great islands in the Arctic sea and also on the tundras along the shores of the continents, the brief summer sun melts the winter snow which has buried the land. Little lakes form, and brooks run into the sea. Sap starts in the dwarf willow stems, and Arctic hares come from their holes to feed on the bursting buds.
</p>
<p>The slopes are then bright with poppies, saxifrages and other hardy flowering plants. Large patches of ground are also covered with orange and gray lichens. All these things are seen where only a few weeks before the land was wrapped in the snow and the darkness of the long Arctic winter.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-052-1" n="1"></note>

<p><hi rend="bold">Trees.</hi> The torrid zone is richest in palm trees, such as the cocoanut, sago and oil palm; in fine cabinet woods, such as ebony, rosewood and mahogany; in dyewoods, such as logwood. The warm belt is richest in forests of yellow pine, yielding lumber and naval stores; and this belt also shares with the belts both north and south of it many useful hardwood trees. The cool belt is the home of most of the soft-wood trees, such as the fir, spruce, hemlock, larch and various so-called pines; also many hardwood trees, such as the maple, oak, ash and elm. The cold belt is the home of few trees, except dwarf birches and willows.

<p><hi rend="bold">Grains.</hi> Rice and millet are the principal grains of the hot and the cool belts of the Old World; much rice is also raised in the warmer parts of America. Corn and wheat are valuable crops both in the warm belts and in the cool belts, but especially in the latter. The hardier grains, such as rye, oats and barley, thrive in the cool belt. The common grains cannot be raised in the cold or frigid zone.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Fiber Plants.</hi> Cotton is the leading fiber plant of the hot and the warm belts. Several kinds of plants that supply fibers for making ropes grow in the same belts, &mdash; jute, in India; the banana or plantain of the Philippine islands, yielding Manila hemp; the century plant of Mexico, producing sisal hemp. The cool belt yields most of the fine flax, from which linen cloth is made; also the common hemp for rope making.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Fruits. </hi>The torrid zone is richest in fruits, such as bananas, breadfruit,
pineapples and many kinds that are seldom seen in the markets of our country. Here are also found dates, oranges, lemons, grapes and olives, but the best lands for these five valuable fruits are in the warm belt. Many grapes are also produced in the cool belt, where apples, peaches, plums, pears and other delicious fruits thrive.

<p><hi rend="bold">36. Where Animals Live
</hi></p>
<p>One of the chief occupations of man is the care of animals. In this work he must observe certain laws of nature, for every kind of creature grows to suit its native haunts. By its teeth, feet arid other parts of its body every animal is fitted to seize and devour its proper food.
</p>
<p>The broad hoofs of the horse and the cow fit these animals to walk and run easily over grass land, where they find their food. Some of their teeth are suited to bite or break off the grass, and the other teeth for grinding it.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-053-a" place="middle of page in back-slash shape"></figure>
<p>The eagle has sharp claws for seizing its prey, and a strong curved beak for tearing the flesh into bits for food.
</p>
<p>Every kind of creature has the kind of covering that suits its native home.
</p>
<p>Whales that live in polar seas have thick layers of fat, or <hi rend="italic">blubber</hi>, to keep the icy waters from chilling their muscles.
Birds that need lightness for flying and also warmth are covered with light. warm feathers. Lobsters have strong shells, not only to protect them from. enemies, but to enable them to crawl among sharp rocks.
</p>
<p>Animals make their homes in or near the places that supply their food.
</p>
<p>Wild cattle search out the grass land. The white bear lives far out on the ice fields where it can catch seals and fish.
</p>
<p>Moths of many kinds lay eggs on the leaves of fruit trees, and the leaves and the fruit become the food of the larv&aelig; when the eggs are hatched. Spiders weave webs in places where flies and other insects flit about.
</p>
<p>Among animals there is always a struggle for food and for life.
</p>
<p>Insects in southern Africa sting and kill thousands of cattle. Tigers pounce upon deer. Many birds feed on worms and insects. Owls kill and eat field mice.
</p>
<p>Every animal has special means of defense or escape from some of its enemies.
</p>
<p>The cow tosses upon her horns. The horse kicks and bites. The deer runs swiftly. The frog dives into the water.
</p>
<p>Nearly all animals have power to move about and seek new homes; but there are barriers they cannot cross. They may be swift and strong, but they cannot live in regions that do not supply their food.
</p>
<p>Grass-eating animals cannot easily cross sandy deserts or high mountains. Animals that feed on forest fruits cannot cross wide grassy plains. Those that live on flesh must make their homes not far from the creatures they devour.
</p>
<p>Many animals have been taken from their native homes and carried to other lands, but man has met with success in this task only when he has selected new homes suited to the needs of the animals, &mdash; especially with regard to their habits in getting proper food.
</p>

<p>The chief barriers to the free travel of wild animals  are the oceans, highlands and deserts. These divide the earth into  great regions called <hi rend="italic">realms</hi>, each having some groups of animals that differ from those of others. But many animals in each region are found also in others, for some can cross places that are barriers to others, and man has helped to scatter the most useful animals, as well as plants, over the earth.

</hi></p>
<p>Wide seas separate the continents of the torrid zone, and each land has therefore many groups of animals unlike those in the others. The land animals cannot cross the sea from one land to another.
</p>
<p>The torrid zone is the home of the largest and fiercest animals. One kind of huge elephant is found in middle Africa, and another kind in southern Asia. In these same regions are found the true buffalo, the humped cattle, called the <hi rend="italic">zebu</hi>, and the rhinoceros.
</p>
<p>The great apes called the <hi rend="italic">gorilla </hi>and the <hi rend="italic">chimpanzee </hi>live near the equator in Africa, and another large ape called the <hi rend="italic">orang-outang</hi> is found near the equator in islands southeast of Asia.
</p>
<p>The portion of Africa south of the Sahara is also the home of the giraffe, the zebra, the leopard and many other animals. Many lions are also found there, as well as farther north in the desert region. The leopard and the lion are both members of the cat family; the fierce tiger, another catlike animal, roams from northern Africa far across the southern half of Asia. Still other beasts of the cat family, namely the jaguar and puma, are found in South and Central America. The puma also hunts its food in the Rocky mountain highland of our own country.
</p>
<p>In the Andes highland are found the llama and alpaca, two animals smaller than the camel but in the same family. The camels live chiefly in the desert regions of Africa and Asia, in and north of the torrid zone. Find out all you can about camels and their uses. Africa is the home of the giant bird known as the <hi rend="italic">ostrich;</hi> but there are other kinds of large ostrichlike birds in South America, Australia and the East Indies. Condors, the largest of flying birds, are found in the Andes. The wild of Australia are very unlike those of other lands. Many, like the kangaroo, have folds in their skin, forming pouches in which they carry their young till they become strong. Two other queer animals of that land lay eggs, though they are not birds.
</p>
<p>The torrid zone has countless monkeys, birds and insects. Large crocodiles infest many of the sluggish rivers of this zone. 
</p>
<p>Most of the common cattle, horses, sheep and hogs are in the temperate zones. When the white men first came to America they found here none of these animals, but the colonists brought many from Europe, and now they are widespread throughout the fertile regions of the world.

<p>Various kinds of large animals belong to the same family as our common cattle. Among these are the huge bison, now nearly extinct, but once found in countless numbers in the prairies of North America; time useful buffalo and zebu of Africa, the East Indies and southern Asia the shaggy yak of the highlands of central Asia; the musk ox of the north polar regions. The true buffalo, the zebu and the yak are among the animals most useful to man. They supply meat and milk for food, they draw wagons and plows and they carry heavy burdens on their backs.
</p>
<p>The striped zebra of Africa and the little donkeys found in almost all lands settled by white men belong to the same family as the horse.
</p>
<p>Wolves and foxes, members of the dog family, are found chiefly in the north temperate zone, where they feed on small animals, wild birds and common fowl.
</p>
<p>The north temperate zone is also the home of the bear family, though many polar bears are also found on both sides of the Arctic circle. The polar or white bear is the largest of the bear family; it lives near the shores of the cold northern oceans, where it can find fish and seals for food. The grizzly bear is a native of the Rocky mountain highland; this is the fiercest of all the bears. Smaller bears are found in the mountains and great forests of nearly all parts of the north temperate zone.
</p>
<p>In winter some bears in cold countries crawl into dens and sleep for several months. They are said to <hi rend="italic">hibernate</hi>. In the spring they issue from their dens in search of food.
</p>
<p>Some bears have long teeth and claws for tearing the flesh of animals on which they feed. Others feed largely on fruits and vegetables. Most bears are fond of honey, and they are often seen searching for beehives in hollow tree trunks and cracks in ledges, where the bees lay up their winter store.

<p>The deer family is widespread over the north temperate zone; some deer are found in the colder zone on the north and the hotter zone on the south. In the cold northern plains, near the Arctic circle, are found great numbers of reindeer in both the New and the Old World. The American reindeer is called the <hi rend="italic">caribou</hi>. The elk of the northern plain of Russia and Siberia, and the American elk, or moose, of the dense forests stretching eastward from the Great Lakes to the sea, are the largest of the deer family. Millions of smaller deer are found in the forests and mountains of the north temperate zone.

<p>The seal, the walrus and the whale are common in the cold seas of the far north. In summer many sea fowl also visit the Arctic shores to feed and to hatch their young but, as a rule, the polar regions have very scanty plant and animal life.
</p>
<p>The walrus is a large animal of the seal family. It has strong ivory tusks which it uses to defend itself and to dig shellfish from the bottom of bays. The walrus is hunted for its oil, ivory, hide and coarse flesh. Eskimos often kill these great animals.

</hi></p>
<p>Rocks from which metals are obtained are called <hi rend="italic">ores</hi>, &mdash; such as iron ore, silver ore, lead ore. A few metals, such as gold and copper, are sometimes found in a pure or very nearly pure state; but most metals are united with other substances and must be treated by various processes to obtain the pure metal.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Iron. </hi>Iron is the most useful of all the metals. Various ores of iron are widely scattered over the earth.
</p>  
<p>Iron and steel are used in making tools for workshops, machines for mills and factories, plates for the hulls of ships, engines and rails for railroads, frames for buildings, and also nails, locks, hinges and countless small articles that may be seen in any hardware store.
</p>
<p>The process of extracting iron from its ores is called <hi rend="italic">smelting</hi>, which means <hi rend="italic">melting</hi>. The usual mode of smelting is as follows The ore, with coal and limestone, is placed in a tall furnace, and the coal is then set on fire.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-056-2" n="2"></note> A hot blast of air is forced through  the burning mass to strengthen the fire. When the iron melts from the ore it settles as a heavy liquid to the bottom of the furnace and is drawn off. The impure matter, or <hi rend="italic">slag</hi>, floats on the surface and can easily be removed.
</p>
<p>The furnace through which the blast of air is driven is known as a <hi rend="italic">blast furnace</hi>. The molten iron is usually run into molds where it cools in short bars weighing about 100 pounds each. In this form it is called <hi rend="italic">pig iron</hi> and is ready for shipment to the foundries, where it may be cast into the form of stoves, hydrants, posts and scores of other objects.
</p>
<p>Iron that is to be used for certain purposes is put through a series of heating processes which change it to <hi rend="italic">steel</hi>. This is used in making rails, engines, steamships, cutlery, tools and other articles that must withstand a great deal of wear and strain, or that must take keen edges.
</p>
<p>Much of the steel is given its form by being <hi rend="italic">rolled</hi>, or pressed between large wheels. The great plates from which the hulls of

some ships are made, and most of the rails seen on railroad beds, are rolled steel.</p> 
<p>Name some things that you can see that are made of iron or steel.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Coal.</hi> Coal is found in layers or beds between other layers of rock. In some places the rock has been worn away, and the coal may be seen at the surface of the earth; but in other places deep mines are dug to reach the layers of coal. This useful mineral is found in many parts of the earth. It is doubly useful if found near beds of iron ore, for the two can then be used in the process of making iron and steel.
</p>
<p>Each bed of coal consists of the remains of great numbers of plants, mostly ferns and mosses: Long ages ago the coal regions were lowlands, and these plants grew in the lowland swamps. A swamp may have continued for centuries making its plant-layers thicker and thicker, as the trees and smaller plants fell in the water. At times the muddy streams running into the swamps buried layers of these plants in sand and clay.
</p>
<p>After the burial of one layer in the sand and clay, perhaps another thick layer of the swamp plants fell and these were in turn buried; then another and another followed.
</p>
<p>As the layers of sand over the plants hardened they became sandstone; the clay hardened into shale; the swamp plants slowly changed to coal, and fossil leaves or trunks of the mosses and ferns are often found in the coal.
</p>
<p>Thus, there are generally several beds of coal, one over another, in a single coal field, showing that several swamps formed there. Some of the coal beds are only a few inches thick; others are several feet.
</p>
<p>Coke is made of soft coal from which certain gases have been driven by heating.
</p>
<p>Large quantities of soft coal are put into ovens that shut out most of the air. <hi rend="italic">See picture.</hi> These are then heated, and some of the gases in. the coal are driven off or burned. Coke gives a stronger and steadier heat than coal and is therefore used in making fine grades of steel that need this kind of heat.
</p>
<p>Charcoal is made from wood.
</p>
<p>Great heaps of wood are covered with turf, so as to admit little air. <hi rend="italic">See picture</hi>. The wood is then slowly burned till nearly everything is driven off but the <hi rend="italic">carbon </hi>or <hi rend="italic">charcoal</hi>. Charcoal resembles true coal, but is much the lighter and more porous.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Petroleum and Natural Gas.</hi> Crude petroleum comes in a liquid state from the ground. From it are made kerosene, gasoline, benzine, vaseline, various oils and many other useful articles.
</p>
<p>The oil known as <hi rend="italic">petroleum</hi>, meaning <hi rend="italic">rock oil</hi>, and also natural gas are thought to result from the slow decay of plants and animals buried ages ago in the sands now changed to rocky layers.
</p>
<p>The oil is reached by sinking pipes down to the oil-bearing layers of porous rock. Some of these pipe wells are more than a fourth of a mile deep.
</p>
<p>Many thousand wells have been sunk in various parts of the earth. Some of these no longer yield oil; others yield only a few barrels a day; while from others many thousand barrels of the 	crude oil gush out in a single day.
</p>
<p>When the natural flow of a well ceases oil is often obtained by pumping. In order

to try to increase the flow, dynamite is sometimes exploded at the bottom of wells. This breaks up the porous rock and in many instances causes the oil to flow much more freely, but at other times the explosion, or "shooting," of the wells stops the flow.
</p>
<p>One of the pictures on this page shows a "shot well" at the moment of the explosion. A great column of oil is thrown into the air. Another picture shows an engine and

pump at work lifting the oil out of a well. The oil is generally pumped into huge tanks. Back of the engine house stands a <hi rend="italic">derrick </hi>over another oil well. The round picture shows many derricks in a Pennsylvania oil town.
</p>
<p>When petroleum is heated it gives off different vapors as the liquid becomes hotter and hotter. These vapors are led away in pipes. The vapors cool and are collected in separate tanks. The various vapors form gasoline, naphtha, benzine, kerosene and other useful liquids. Vaseline is made from the residue left in the main vat after heating. Many kinds of oils for oiling machines are made from petroleum.
</p>
 

<pb n="58" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-058" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
<p>Natural gas is used chiefly for heating purposes. The gas can be regulated to give strong and steady heat, and this fuel is therefore of great value in iron mills and glass works, although coal or coke can be used for fuel in both. Natural gas is also used as a fuel in dwellings near the gas regions. In places having gas wells the low cost of the gas, for fuel has caused very rapid growth in manufactures.
</p>
<p>Natural gas and petroleum doubtless have a common origin in the decay of plants and animals in ancient layers of sand or mud forming rocks having many pores. The gas, like the oil, fills the pores and runs out as soon as pipes are sunk through upper layers of rocks, such as shale or clay rock, that have long prevented them from escaping.
</p>
<p>Many of the gas wells that once flowed with great pressure have now stopped flowing. Others now flow with weak pressure; still others have been flowing steadily for many years.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Copper. </hi>Iron is the only metal more useful than copper. The latter is generally used mixed with other metals, and these are of greater service than pure copper.
</p>
<p>Thus copper is mixed with gold to make gold coins. The pure gold is so soft that it would not last long as money. Gold jewelry also contains copper, to make it wear better.
</p>
<p>The useful metal called <hi rend="italic">brass </hi>is made by melting together copper and another metal known as zinc. The bronze of which so many beautiful statues are cast is made of copper and tin melted together.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Gold and Silver.</hi> Gold and silver are called <hi rend="italic">precious metals</hi>, but they are not nearly so useful as iron or copper. The value of the precious metals is largely due to their scarcity.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-058-a" place="below middle on the right of left column of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Smeltery</hi></figDesc></figure>
<p>Gold is found pure or almost pure in nature. It is often taken from veins of quartz rock or from old river gravels formed largely of particles washed from veins of quartz.
</p>
<p>The gold may be separated from quartz by crushing the rock and then mixing the mass with quick silver and water. The gold and quicksilver unite to form a new compound. This is then heated and the quicksilver is driven off as vapor, leaving the gold. The vapor of the quicksilver is cooled and can be used again.
</p>
<p>The building in which the gold is taken from the rock is called a <hi rend="italic">smeltery</hi>.
</p>
<p>There are other ways of taking gold from rocks, by using acids in the place of quicksilver.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-058-b" place="above middle of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Copper mine, 2000 feet deep, near lake Superior
</hi></figDesc></figure>
<p>In some places where gravel beds are rich in gold strong streams of water are sent from pipes against the gravel to loosen it. The gravel is then put into a long trough in which water is running over cleats or grooves holding quick silver. The gold is taken in by the quicksilver, and the gravel is washed away.
</p>
<p>The ores of silver are treated in various ways to obtain the precious gray or white metal of which so many useful and beautiful objects are made.
</p>
<p>Gold arid silver are found in nearly all mountainous regions of the world. We shall learn where the richest mines are when we study the different countries.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Building Stone.</hi> The principal kinds of stone used for building purposes are limestone, marble, granite, sandstone and slate.
</p>
<p>Try to get samples of each of these kinds of stone and examine them carefully.
</p>
<p>Limestone is made of the tiny shells of creatures that lived ages ago in the sea. As the little creatures died the shells settled on the bottom, making a thick bed. In time this became hard rock and formed limestone. It is called <hi rend="italic">limestone </hi>because it is mostly made of the lime that was in the shells. Some limestone is made of coral.
</p>
<p>In some places in the earth limestone has been greatly heated and firmly pressed, making it hard and fine, with countless crystals. This form of limestone is called <hi rend="italic">marble</hi>. It is not only used for building purposes, but it is also carved into many beautiful statues and vases. This rock will take a fine polish.
</p>
<p>Granite is another rock that has been formed deep down in the earth, under great pressure and with great heat, and having crystals throughout its mass. If you will examine a piece of granite you can doubtless easily see the crystals, &mdash; some white, some pink or green, some perhaps in thin shining scales. Sometimes there are also black crystals in the rocks. The value of granite is due largely to its hardness and the fact that it takes a beautiful polish. One of the pictures on the next page shows men carving statues in granite.

<p>When sand forms in deep beds in water, it is sometimes hardened into rock. This is known as <hi rend="italic">sandstone</hi>. It is very useful for making walls of buildings; and some pure sandstones are melted and changed into glass. One of the pictures on the next page shows men blowing forms in glass made of sandstone. It is the quartz sand in the sandstone that melts and forms glass. Much of the petroleum and natural gas of the world is found in porous sandstone.

<p><hi rend="bold">39. Highways of Trade
</hi></p>
<p>No people of any country can produce all the articles they need, though they may produce a surplus of some. But they can buy what they need from people of other lands and can sell some of the articles which they themselves raise on farms, dig out of mines or make in workshops.
</p>
<p>Thus, our country has cotton, wheat, copper and scores of other useful things to sell, but we must send to other lands for most of our coffee, tea, spices and many other products.
</p>
<p>The buying and selling of goods is called <hi rend="italic">trade</hi>; but trade on a large scale may be called <hi rend="italic">commerce</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Domestic commerce</hi> is that carried on between various parts of one country; <hi rend="italic">foreign commerce</hi> is that carried on between one country and another.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-059-b" place="above bottom at middle of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Glass blowing</hi></figDesc></figure>
<p>At the stores or shops we buy articles for use in our homes. Perhaps these retail stores in turn trade with larger wholesale stores. In order to supply the great wholesale stores, perhaps shiploads or trainloads of goods are brought from foreign lands or from other parts of the same country. If from a foreign land, we may call the buying <hi rend="italic">foreign trade</hi> or <hi rend="italic">foreign commerce;</hi> if from some part of the same country, it is <hi rend="italic">domestic trade</hi> or <hi rend="italic">domestic commerce</hi>.
</p>
<p>The principal highways of trade are oceans, railroads, lakes, rivers and canals.
</p>
<p>The sea spreads in one vast body round the continents, so that a ship can go from any one of the oceans to the others. The oceans form the main highways of commerce between countries far distant from one another.
</p>
<p>Coast cities in which freight is handled for ocean commerce are called <hi rend="italic">ports </hi>or <hi rend="italic">seaports</hi>. The best ports are on deep and spacious harbors sheltered from gales and storm waves.
</p>
<p>The ports are located where they can most easily handle products carried by ships. As freight charges are lower by water than by trains or wagons on land, the cities are built just as far inland as the deep and safe waters reach towards the producing regions, &mdash; whether farms, forest, mines or manufacturing districts. The goods to be sent from the country, or the <hi rend="italic">exports</hi>, then need to be carried only the shortest distance necessary to reach the ships; and the goods brought by the ships, or the <hi rend="italic">imports</hi>, are so much the nearer to the people who are to use them.
</p>
<p>The rivers that are of greatest use as routes of trade are those which are deep and slow, and which flow through the most productive regions. They are doubly useful if they flow in the direction in which most of the people live who are to use the products, or who are to send back goods for the people along the great rivers.
</p>
<p>Thus, the Mississippi river and its great branches flow through the middle portion of our country, where there are grainfields, forests, grazing lands, cotton fields, sugar plantations and cities having many mills and workshops. Immense quantities of products are therefore freighted on these streams. The lower part of the main river is broad and deep, and large ocean steamers go many miles up the stream to unload the imports they have brought and to load articles of export.
</p>
<p>Large lakes and inland seas that extend in the direction of trade are important aids to commerce.
</p>
<p>Thus, the Great Lakes along the north east border of the most fertile part of our country are of more value to trade than any other lake route or any river route in the world. Not far from the
shores of these lakes are wheat and corn fields, pastures, coal mines, iron mines, copper mines, oil wells and large manufacturing cities. A very large portion of the surplus products of this region are bought by the people of Europe. The Mississippi river runs southward, while Europe lies far to the east; the river therefore is not the best route for this trade of the lake region with Europe, but the lakes extend in just the right direction to help in sending these
 

<pb n="60" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-060" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
goods eastward. From the lakes most of the goods are over land by railroads or by canal, to the great seaports along the eastern coast, where ocean steamers are ready to freight the goods to ports in Europe.</p>


<p>In progressive countries rail roads
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-060-a" place="about top of left column of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">A steamship that carries freight and passengers across the Atlantic</hi></figDesc></figure>
are fast taking the trade away from rivers and canals, as the loss of time by the latter is so great, and as the railroads' are now carrying freight at much cheaper rates than in years past.
</p>
<p>Most of the railroads in the world are in the United States and in Europe, and nearly one half are in our country.
</p>
<p>The railroads of the United States are four times as long as the navigable rivers, or long enough to reach about seven times round the earth. If these railroads were destroyed, all the gold and silver money in the world would not pay for rebuilding them.
</p>
<p>In early times inland towns grew most rapidly along the rivers, lakes and canals, but now the most rapid growth of inland towns in many parts of our country is due almost wholly to railroads. The best locations of course are where railroads cross each other or where the roads reach navigable waters. Nearly every city and large town in our country can now be reached by one or more lines of railroads.
</p>
<p>The commerce of the world is of such great importance to all civilized nations that people seek in every possible way to help and protect it.
</p>
<p>Lighthouses are built on dangerous coasts and along the main channels of harbors and rivers. Beacons, buoys, bells and fog horns are placed where they are most likely to give warning of danger. Light-ships, with lights, bells and horns, are anchored near shoal places. Along many parts of the coast men and boats are stationed to assist vessels in distress, and to try to save the lives of sailors if the vessels are wrecked.
</p>
<p>Mud is dredged from the bottom of harbors to deepen them; rocks are removed from channels; sea walls are built to shield vessels from storm waves.

<p>Nations employ men known as <hi rend="italic">consuls </hi>in all large seaports. The consuls try to promote trade, to protect shipping and to secure rights that belong to the citizens of their nations. To assist in this work armed vessels (<hi rend="italic">see picture</hi>) are kept in readiness to go to any port where commerce needs protection.

sea, are a valuable aid to commerce. When a steamer sails with freight for a foreign port, agents abroad can be cabled when to expect it and what to do with it. Consuls can cable for help in times of trouble, and important news of all kinds for newspapers can be sent along these wires under the sea.

</p>
<p>After the famous voyage of Columbus, in 1492, the various nations of western Europe sent expeditions to explore and settle the New World. Foremost among these nations were England, France and Spain.
</p>
<p>Some of the French explorers went up the St. Lawrence river and the Great lakes, thence down the Mississippi river. Other explorers of the same nation went up the Mississippi from its mouth. Many people of French descent now live in the lower Mississippi valley and speak the French language, but they are greatly outnumbered by the English-speaking people in the same region. Many of the 
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-061-a" place="middle of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Scenes in the city of Washington</hi></figDesc></figure>
 early white settlers in the southwest portion of our country came from Mexico, which was settled by Spanish people.
</p>
<p>The early English settlers in the United States made their homes along the Atlantic coast, both north and south, and for many years did not spread far inland.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-061-2" n="2"></note>
</p>
<p>There were many reasons for this: the ships bringing colonists landed them on the east coast; many wished to remain there to trade with the people in Europe; the rugged Appalachian highland, covered with forests, stood between the coast settlements and the prairies; there were no rivers flowing from the prairies to the east coast of the United States; European nations hostile to English claimed the St. Lawrence and Mississippi river systems, and for many years the English colonists could not  use those water-ways; moreover, warlike Indian tribes held the lands a little back from the coast. 
</p>
<p>At length the year 1776 arrived, and with it came great changes in the colonies, then thirteen in number. Great Britain had made the colonists pay taxes which they had no share in voting, but in that year the colonies took the name of states and chose brave men who met in Philadelphia and voted that their land should no longer be under British rule. After a long struggle, known as the <hi rend="italic">Rovolutionary war</hi>, Great Britain gave up her claim to what hade been the
<note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-061-1" n="1">There is a map of the United States on pages 72 and 73.
</note>
<note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-061-2" n="2">Among the important settlements made by colonists of nations other than the British were the following: the Dutch along the Hudson river; the Swedes near the mouth of the Delaware river; the French around Charleston, S.C., and in the Mississippi valley; the Spaniards in Florida.</note>
Thirteen colonies and also to lands claimed by these colonies westward to the Mississippi.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-061-3" n="3"></note>
</p>
<p>In 1776 the colonies voted to form "free and independent" states, and all the states together formed  a Union which a few years later become the <hi rend="italic">United States of America</hi>.
</p>
<p>At the close of the Rovolutionary war the United States reached from the Atlantic coast to the Mississippi river, but Spain then held the peninsula of Florida and a narrow strip of land running westward along the Gulf coast. 
</p>
<p>Since the Revolutionary war the United States has acquired the lands westward to the Pacific ocean, southward to the gulf of Mexico, and also the great peninsula of Alaska, besides several groups of islands. The area, including Alaska and the island possessions, is now a little less than 4,000,000 square miles.
</p>
<p>After the Revolutionary war many people moved westward along the river branches, then across the Appalachian highland and by way of the Great Lakes to the prairies, where the fertile lands were found ready for millions of settlers. As wagon roads, canals and railroads were built, the growth of country became very rapid. Forts and trading stations on the rivers, the Great Lakes, the canals and the railroads soon grew to be towns and cities.
</p>
<p>While the upper half of the Mississippi valley was thus being settled a great change was also taking place in the southern half of the country. Thousands of acres were

planted with cotton; and the region grew very rapidly in wealth and population.</p>
<p>Soon after the first English colonists came to this country they received a cargo of Negro slaves from Africa. As the colonies grew and more laborers were needed, many more people of the black race were brought to this country. They proved to be of greatest service in the cotton fields of the South. The invention of the cotton gin (<hi rend="italic">see lesson 33</hi>), and also of better machinery for weaving cloth, created a great demand for cotton and therefore for cheap labor. Later all the slaves were freed.
</p>
<p>There are nearly 9,000,000 Negroes in the United States.
</p>
<p>About fifty years ago gold was discovered in California, and many thousand people flocked there in search of fortunes. Silver and gold have also been found in other parts of the Western highland, and towns and cities have grown up in many places near the rich mines.
</p>
<p>Some of the gold seekers went in wagons or on horseback across the dry Western plains and the Rocky mountain highland. Others reached the gold fields by way of the isthmus of Panama, &mdash; going by water to and from that neck of land. Shiploads of gold seekers went round cape Horn and thence up the Pacific coast to San Francisco. Gold in the mountains first drew settlers in large numbers to the far West, but products of far greater value are now taken from the grainfields, the vineyards, the fruit groves and the pastures of some of the Western states.

They give their name to the entire highland. The Rocky mountains extend far northward into the basin of the Yukon river, in Alaska, and southward as far as Texas.
</p>
<p>Among the well-known summits of the Rocky mountains are Pikes peak and Longs peak. These masses of rock may be clearly seen from the plains on the east of the great chain. Many of the Rocky mountain peaks are over two and a half miles high.
</p>
<p>These mountains in the United States are in the path of the westerly winds from over the Pacific, but they lie far inland, with other ranges between them and the coast, and therefore do not receive much rainfall.
</p>
<p>This great mountain system yields more gold and silver than any other part of the continent.
</p>
<p>The lofty <hi rend="italic">Sierra Nevada</hi>, meaning <hi rend="italic">snowy range</hi>, forms a western rim for the great plateau, but there are many lesser ranges between this and the eastern rim in the Rocky mountains.
</p>
<p>The highest peak in the Sierra Nevada is Mt. Whitney, near the southern end. It is higher than either of the two peaks named above.
</p>
<p>The Sierra Nevada is in the path of the moist westerly winds, with only the low Coast range between it and the sea. The west slope of the Sierra Nevada therefore receives heavy rainfall and has large forests of soft-wood trees, some of which are famous for their great size. This range, like the "Rockies," has rich gold mines.
</p>
<p>On the north the Sierra Nevada joins the <hi rend="italic">Cascade range</hi>, consisting chiefly of mountains of lava or old volcanoes. Some of the high peaks bear glaciers on their sides.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-066-b" place="low middle of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Canyon of the Colorado</hi></figDesc></figure>
<p>Mt. Shasta, rising about where the ends of the two great ranges meet, is a volcanic cone noted for its beauty. Other grand peaks, farther north, are Mt. Hood and Mt. Rainier.
</p>
<p>The Cascade range, like the Sierra Nevada, receives heavy rainfall from the westerly winds, and the west slope is densely wooded.
</p>
<p>A large part of the plateau region between the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky mountains is an inland basin having no river flowing to the sea. It is known as the <hi rend="italic">Great Basin</hi>. The rainfall in this basin, east of the high Sierra, is so light that there is not enough water to overflow it. The streams dry up on the plains or enter lakes from which the water evaporates.
</p>
<p>How are salt lakes formed? <hi rend="italic">See lesson 5</hi>.
</p>
<p>The streams of the Great Basin form many salt lakes. The largest of these, known as the <hi rend="italic">Great Salt lake</hi>, is four times as salt as the ocean. A cupful of the lake water contains a tablespoonful of salt. The area of this lake is over 2000 square miles.
</p>
<p>In some parts of the basin water is led in canals from the rivers and is used to irrigate the land. It thus becomes possible to raise good crops of grain.
</p>
<p>A broad region southeast of the Great Basin consists of high plateaus known as the <hi rend="italic">Colorado plateaus</hi>. In them the rivers have cut deep canyons. The largest and most famous of these canyons is that which has been worn down by the Colorado river.
</p>
<p>For a long distance the canyon of the Colorado is about a mile deep. Its sides consist of rocks of many colors, &mdash; gray, brown, red, yellow and purple. At times of sunrise and sunset first one colorand then another catches the light or is thrown into shadow, &mdash; making a marvelous display.
</p>
<p>Ruins of strange dwellings are found in shallow caves under the cliffs in some of the canyons of the Colorado plateau region. The Indians who made these dwellings disappeared before the white men set foot in that country. The people of that ancient race are now called <hi rend="italic">Cliff Dwellers</hi>. In their homes in the cliffs are found coarsely woven cloth and various forms of pottery. The villages were built in the cliffs in order that the tribes might be safe from attack.
</p>
<p>Among the wild animals of the Rocky mountain highland are bears, pumas and Rocky mountain sheep, or bighorns. A few bison or buffaloes also are found there. In the far north, where this highland enters Alaska, are found many caribou, or American reindeer.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Pacific Slope</hi>. Close to the shore of the Pacific lie several mountain ridges, forming a low <hi rend="italic">Coast range</hi>. Between this range and the Sierra Nevada is the long and narrow <hi rend="italic">valley of California</hi>, famous for its wheat and fruits. Both north and south of this valley there are many other smaller but fertile valleys, especially west of the Cascade mountains in Oregon.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Appalachian Highland.</hi> East of the Rocky mountains spreads the great Central plain; along its east side rises the Appalachian highland.
</p>



 

<pb n="67" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-067" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />

<p>Most of the ranges of this highland are long ridges. Some still show the arching layers of rock, like those in the middle picture on page 9. Many more were formed in this way, but have been greatly changed by rain and streams.
</p>
<p>Not far from the northeast end of this highland stands a group of peaks known as the <hi rend="italic">White mountains</hi>, noted for the beauty of their scenery.
</p>
<p>Mt. Washington, one of these peaks, is the highest mountain in the northeast part of the United States; it is a little less than a mile and a quarter high.
</p>
<p>West of the White mountains are the low ridges of the <hi rend="italic">Green mountains</hi>; and still farther west, across lake Champlain, are the <hi rend="italic">Adirondacks</hi>.
</p>
<p>Can you find in your history the story of Ethan Allen and his "Green mountain boys"?
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-067-a" place="up middle of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Home of Cliff Dwellers</hi>
</figDesc></figure>
<p>The Adirondacks are mountains that for very long ages have been worn down by rains and streams and, as in other regions of the same kind, layers that were once deeply buried and that contain rich deposits of iron ore are now near the surface.
</p>
<p>The three groups of mountains above named are cut off from the rest of the Appalachian highland by a valley in which flows the river Hudson and its branch, the Mohawk. This valley extends all the way across the highland and forms a highway of trade between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic coast.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-067-b" place="low middle of page"></figure>
<p>In early times war like tribes of Indians held the Mohawk valley and for many years did not allow the colonists to make this a route of trade or a highway for reaching the fertile prairie region farther inland. Later, the Erie canal was built along the valley, from lake Erie to the Hudson river, and an immense trade was carried on between the lake region and the seacoast. Still later, railroad lines were built along the same route. Valleys across highlands are very important aids to commerce.
</p>
<p>For some distance southwest of the Hudson river the Appalachian highland is not so high as the White mountains or the Adirondacks; then it rises farther south in the <hi rend="italic">Blue ridge</hi> and attains its greatest height in Mt. Mitchell, one of the <hi rend="italic">Black mountains</hi>, a little higher than Mt. Washington.
</p>
<p>Among the ridges of the Appalachians lie long fertile valleys. This whole region receives plentiful rainfall, and most of the ranges or ridges are covered with forests. Some of the ridges are very rich in iron ore and coal.
</p>
<p>Along the western side of the Appalachian highland lie broad plateaus that are deeply cut by rivers, and have a general slope towards the Mississippi river. The general name of this plateau region is the <hi rend="italic">Allegheny plateau</hi>, but some rugged parts are called <hi rend="italic">mountains</hi>, as the Cumberland mountains in the southern part. This plateau is rich in iron ore and coal.
</p>
<p>Deer are found in the forests of the Appalachian highland. The moose, the largest of the deer family, is often seen in the forests in the extreme northeast part of our country.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Coastal Plain</hi>. Beginning at the mouth of the Hudson river, and reaching all along the Atlantic coast to Florida, a wide slope descends from the Appalachian highland to the seacoast. The part of this slope tear the highland is rough foothill land, but nearer the coast the grade is so gentle that the tides are felt many miles up the rivers. This level part is known as the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic coastal plain</hi>.
</p>
<p>This is one of the plains formed of sediment under the sea and then slowly uplifted, till the sea-bottom became dry land. <hi rend="italic">See lesson 6</hi>. It is made of layers of clay, of sand, of gravel and fine soil, washed into the sea ages ago by the rivers and then slowly uplifted to form dry plains.
</p>
<p>Another part of the same great coastal plain stretches far inland from the shore of the gulf of Mexico and extends from Florida to Rio Grande and beyond. This part is known as the <hi rend="italic">Gulf coastal plain</hi>.

<p><hi rend="bold">Map Studies of States<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-070-1" n="1"></note>:</hi> &mdash; The United States consists of forty-five states, six territories, various island possessions and the District of Columbia. The city of Washington, the capital of the United States, is in this district.
</p>
<p>The states and territories differ in their form of government, as we shall see in lesson 83. The territories are: Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Indian Territory, New Mexico and Oklahoma. With these exceptions, all the divisions on the map on pages 72-73 are states.

Next west is the row whose eastern parts are in the fertile prairies, but whose western parts are in the dry Western plains; name them, beginning with North Dakota. What two territories are north of Texas?
</p>
<p>Farther west lies the Rocky mountain tier, with three states and one territory; name them. Between the Rocky mountains and the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges are three states and one territory of the basin or plateau region, two of the states lying side by side in the Great Basin; name them.
</p>
<p>Name the three states that border on the Pacific. Where is the territory of Alaska? <hi rend="italic">See map on page 65</hi>.

<p>The rivers flowing across this long coastal plain show that the part bordering on the Atlantic slopes to the southeast; the part lying along the gulf of Mexico slopes to the south.
</p>
<p>All parts of this coastal plain receive plentiful rains. The part in the cool belt produces fruits and tobacco; the part in the warm belt is called the <hi rend="italic">Southern plain</hi>. This plain produces great quantities of cotton. Parts are covered with yellow-pine forests, yielding lumber and naval stores. <hi rend="italic">See lesson 33</hi>. Describe the seasons of the Southern plain. <hi rend="italic">See lesson 21</hi>.
</p>
<p>Part of the peninsula of Florida is in the coastal plain, but the other part is built mainly of coral.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Prairies.</hi> South, southwest and west of the Great Lakes are the fertile plains known as <hi rend="italic">prairies</hi>. Parts of the prairies are level; other parts have the form of long low waves and are said to be <hi rend="italic">rolling prairies</hi>.
</p>
<p>The soil of the prairies is deep and rich; rainfall is plentiful, and this region yields more corn and wheat than

any other part of the world. Immense numbers of cattle, sheep, horses and hogs are raised on these grassy plains.
</p>
<p>Describe the seasons of the prairies. <hi rend="italic">See lesson 21</hi>.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Western Plains</hi>. The part of the Central plain lying east of the Rocky mountains, but west of the prairies and Gulf coastal plain, is called the <hi rend="italic">Western plains</hi>. Parts of the plains, near the mountains, are more than a mile above sea level, and the whole plain has a general slope eastward.
</p>
<p>The Western plains lie far inland from the seacoast. They are in the path of the westerly winds, but several ranges of high mountains lie between them and the Pacific. The moist winds from the gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic ocean seldom reach inland so far. The Western plains are therefore dry, but enough grass grows on them to support many cattle.
</p>
<p>These dry plains are not a desert, nor are they fertile, except in the large river valleys or near the mountains where many small streams flow out. There are good farms where canals and ditches have been made to turn aside river water over the land.

N<hi rend="small cap">OTE</hi>: &mdash; This map shows how the winds blow in one of the common storms that move eastward across the United States and around the world as shown on the round map on this page. From all sides the winds circle or eddy towards a center and then rise rapidly to a great height. Clouds form over large areas, and rain or snow falls. The arrowheads show that the winds are eddying towards the storm center, where the dark shading shows the rain area, and the lighter shading the cloud area. The winds, rains and clouds are whirling eastward.</figDesc></figure>
northern and southern parts of the country is not very  great; but the former has much more severe winters than the latter.
</p>
<p>The winds from the seas that border on the United States greatly affect the climate. Thus, warm moist winds from over the gulf of Mexico blow inland and give bountiful rains to the lands along its shores and also far northward up the Mississippi valley and the southern Appalachians. The southeast winds from over the Gulf stream bear plentiful rains to the southeastern part of the country.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-074-b" place="low middle of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">General plan of the winds.</hi> (The dotted areas indicate rain)</figDesc></figure>
<p>A cold polar current flows along the northeast coast of North America and even reaches the northeast coast of the United States. East winds blowing shoreward from over that current are very chilling; but this same part of the country more often has warmer west or southwest winds blowing offshore.
</p>
<p>The west coast of the United States feels the strongest effects of the westerly winds from over the Pacific. This broad ocean cools but little in winter and warms but little in summer; the winds blowing over it have therefore an even or steady temperature that they give to the lands over which they first blow. Thus, they keep the winters of lands along the Pacific coast from being very cold, and the summers from being very hot. No polar current ever reaches this coast.
</p>
<p>Winds gradually acquire the temperature of the land or water over which they move. Thus, the westerly winds of winter reach the west coast as cool, but not cold, rain bearers; they give out most of their rains on the western ranges of the Rocky mountain highland, and also become much cooler as they flow over the high ranges; then they move eastward across the winter snow fields that often cover the northern prairies, and finally as bitter freezing winds they blow over the coast lands farther east and take their course across the Atlantic. Before reaching Europe they must cross the Gulf stream, where they are again warmed, and thus they bear warmth and moisture over the west coast of that continent.
</p>
<p>In summer the same winds crossing the dry Western plains and the warm prairies blow as warm or hot winds over the coast lands farther east. Regions far inland do not feel the effect of ocean waters so much as lands near the coast; the inland regions therefore have greater extremes of heat and cold in summer and winter.
</p>
<p>Most parts of the United States, except the western plateau region and the plains along the eastern base of the Rocky mountains, receive plentiful rains.
</p>
<p>The middle and northwest parts of the Pacific coast have bountiful rains from the westerly winds; the southern part of this coast has winter rains from the same winds, but the summers are dry, as these winds then move farther north.
</p>
<p>The western interior of the country averages less than twenty inches of rainfall in a year, except on the mountains. Lands that have only twenty inches or less of rain often fail to produce good crops, unless aided by irrigation; but the crops of irrigated lands are often far superior to those that depend upon rainfall.

<p>Over the eastern half of the United States there is plenty of rain. The rainfall is least along the border of the dry Western plains, and thence increases to over fifty inches towards the sea on the east and south. The rainfall in the east is heaviest where the moist winds from over the gulf of Mexico blow over on the Southern plain and the southern Appalachians.

</p>
<p>Study the cotton map and name the Atlantic states that produce cotton; the Gulf states; name two territories and two states having
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-076-a" place="up left column of page"></figure> 
no seacoast, that have very rich cotton lands, as shown by the darker tint on the map.
</p>
<p>In which heat belt are the cotton states? <hi rend="italic">See lesson 20</hi>. What are the seasons of this cotton belt? <hi rend="italic">See lesson 21</hi>.
</p>
<p>What does lesson 42 tell about the climate of the cotton belt, &mdash; both the coastal plain and the foothill region?
</p>
<p>Review lesson 33 and tell how the fiber of cotton is separated from the seed; what use is made of the fiber and the seed; to what extent cotton cloth is used in the world. Lesson 50 tells more about the use of cotton seed.
</p>
<p>In order to ripen its seeds and thus produce long and soft fibers, the cotton plant requires a very long warm season. For this reason it thrives only in the warm or hot belts of the earth. It also needs plentiful rains.
</p>
<p>The three leading cotton regions of the world are the Southern states, the fertile plains along the lower part of the river Nile and in its delta and the rich plains of India.
</p>
<p>Texas leads all other states in the quantity of cotton produced. Georgia ranks second. The best grade of cotton formerly grew on the low sandy islands along the coast of Georgia and South Carolina. This is known as <hi rend="italic">Sea-island</hi> cotton. Nearly all the cotton of this kind is now raised on the mainland in southern Georgia and northern Florida, as well as in South Carolina. Much of it is sent to England to be woven into fine cloth.
</p>
<p>Much of the Texas cotton is shipped from Galveston; a large part of the Sea-island cotton, as well as of the other grades of cotton raised farther inland, is shipped from Savannah. The cotton states along the Mississippi and its branches send great quantities of the fiber to New Orleans, where it is placed on ocean steamers and sent to foreign countries or to some of the great Atlantic cities of the North. Large quantities of cotton are sent by rail to the great port of New York and thence by steamships to Europe. Charleston, Wilmington and Norfolk, as well as other Atlantic seaports, have a large trade in cotton. New York and New Orleans are the chief cities in exporting this useful fiber.
</p>
<p>Most of the cotton mills of the United States are in the northeast part of the country (<hi rend="italic">see tinted areas and dots on the map</hi>) and in many of the Southern states.
</p>
<p>Strong water power from swift streams gave the northeastern states of the Union an early start in manufacturing. Steam has now largely taken the place of water power, but hundreds of mills with their skilled workmen and costly machinery still hold a very large part of the cloth-making industry to this district, although the raw cotton must be carried far from the fields to the looms.
</p>
<p>The cloth-making industry in the cotton states is young, but its growth has been very rapid. The people of the South are taking great pride in their mills. They have rapidly gained skill in the use of the best modern cotton machinery, and are showing much energy in making fine grades of cloth. Most of the cotton mills of the South are in the Carolinas, Georgia and Alabama.
</p>
<p>The cities of Fall River and Lowell, in Massachusetts, make more cotton cloth than any other two cities in
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-076-b" place="up middle of right column of page"></figure> 
America. New York and Boston handle much of the raw cotton used in the mills of the northeast.
</p>
<p>The United States ranks first in the production and export of cotton. About one third of the crop is used in the mills of this country; but raw cotton to the value of about $250,000,000 is sent each year to foreign lands. A large portion of this goes to the British Isles, and the rest chiefly to Germany, France and other countries of Europe. These foreign countries also import great quantities of raw cotton from India and the Nile valley.

<p><hi rend="bold">44. Wheat
</hi></p>
<p>What does lesson 34 tell about wheat?
</p>
<p>The prairies are the principal wheat region of this country. Smaller quantities are raised also in the Middle Atlantic states, in the valley of California and other Pacific valleys farther north, and in Texas.
</p>
<p>Wheat thrives best in the cool belt, but is raised in some parts of the warm belt. It is a more hardy grain than corn, not being so easily killed by frost or cold weather. One of the best wheat regions is in the cooler prairies of Minnesota and the Dakotas, and even much farther north in Canada.
</p>
<p>A large part of this region, in the valley of the Red river, is the bed of an ancient lake, and therefore has fine rich soil.
</p>
<p>The richest part of the wheat belt lies between the Great Lakes on the north, and the Ohio and Missouri rivers on the south and west; but there are fertile wheat fields still farther south and west, as shown by the map.
</p>
<p>We have seen that the rapid growth of the South was very largely due to the invention of the cotton gin. The rapid growth of the prairie states was due fully as much to the invention of machines for reaping and binding grain.
</p>
<p>The city of Minneapolis has the largest flour mills in the world. Among American cities St. Louis ranks high in making flour. Along the waterway of the Great Lakes, the Erie canal and the Hudson river, from Chicago to New York, every large city has extensive flour mills.
</p>
<p>Chicago and the other lake ports handle thousands of shiploads of wheat each year. Much wheat is carried to New York, Baltimore, Galveston and other large Atlantic cities, and is placed on steamships bound chiefly for the countries of western Europe.
</p>
<p>Most of the wheat crop of the valley of California, either in the form of grain or flour, passes through San Francisco.
</p>
<p>The United States leads all other countries of the world in the production of this important cereal. France, India and Russia also produce very large crops.
</p>
<p>Wheat and flour rank next in value to cotton as exports from the United States. Like cotton and corn, they find a foreign market chiefly in the British Isles and other countries of Europe.

<p><hi rend="bold">45. Corn
</hi></p>
<p>Review what lesson 34 tells about corn.
</p>
<p>Corn is widespread over the eastern half of our country, except in the marshy or sandy lands along the gulf of Mexico, and in the extreme north where early frosts are common or where there are dense forests. The best region for the growth of corn is in the southern half of the prairies. This corn belt stretches east and west, passing between the cities of Chicago and St. Louis. It reaches the border of the Allegheny plateau on the east and the great plains on the west.
</p>
<p>Describe the seasons in this corn belt. What winds bring most of the rainfall to the region?
</p>
<p>Great quantities of corn are used to fatten live stock, especially hogs and cattle. There is more live stock in the corn belt than in any other part of the United States.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-077-b" place="low middle of right column of page"></figure> 
<p>Chicago and the other large lake and river ports serve as centers for the collection and distribution of corn. New York, Baltimore and other great eastern seaports carry on a large foreign trade in this grain.
</p>
<p>The United States supplies the larger part of the corn of commerce. This grain is sent chiefly to the British

Isles and Germany, to help feed the millions of people in the workshops of those countries.</p>
<p>When the early white settlers came to America they found here a new kind of grain raised by the Indians. To these white men the word corn was a general term meaning <hi rend="italic">grain</hi>. They gave the new grain the name of <hi rend="italic">Indian corn</hi>. Since that time this valuable grain has spread to nearly all fertile lands having long and hot summer weather.

<p><hi rend="bold">46. Oats, Barley and Rye
</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Reading Lesson
</hi></p>
<p>Oats are not native to America and have not been so widely sown in our country as corn or wheat. In recent years, however, the crops of oats have greatly increased and are now very valuable.
</p>
<p>Oats are much hardier than corn, often growing in a poorer soil and a colder climate, but thriving also in the fertile prairies and still farther south in the coastal plains. In the United States, as well as in other parts of the world, the oat crops are largest in about the same districts that produce the most wheat and corn. Nearly all the oats exported from our country are sent to England.
</p>
<p>Barley and rye are hardy grains, but they do not take a leading

place among the cereal crops of the United States. Rye is an important food product in Russia, Germany and other parts of Europe.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">47. Tobacco
</hi></p>
<p>What does lesson 33 tell about tobacco?
</p>
<p>The chief tobacco districts in the United States are the Ohio river valley; the foothill slopes east of the Blue ridge in Virginia and the middle part of the Carolinas; the district crossing from lake Ontario to Chesapeake bay; and the Connecticut river valley.
</p>
<p>Louisville is a famous tobacco market. New York, St. Louis and Richmond are great manufacturing centers for tobacco goods. Key West and Tampa, in Florida, make many cigars from Cuban tobacco.
</p>
<p>The United States raises more tobacco than any other country. India, central Europe, Russia and both the East and the West Indies supply large quantities of tobacco. The Cuban tobacco is said to be the best in the world. It grows chiefly in the lowlands of the western part of the island.
</p>
<p>Our country has a large export trade in <hi rend="italic">leaf tobacco</hi>. Immense quantities are sent through the ports of New York and Baltimore to the manufacturing countries of western Europe.

</hi></p>
<p>What does lesson 33 tell about the yellow pine forests of the Southern states? Explain what is meant by naval stores and tell how some kinds are made.
</p>
<p>What does lesson 34 tell about the soft-wood forests round the Great Lakes? Explain the work of lumbering in the forests of this region.
</p>
<p>Only a few trees grow wild on the Western plains or in the Great Basin of our country, because the rainfall there is so light.
</p>
<p>Large areas in the prairies are treeless, but trees grow in the lowlands along the rivers and many have been planted wherever the land is settled.
</p>
<p>The soil in most parts of the prairies is very fine and compact. Such soil is not so well suited to forests as the looser soil of highlands or of moist sandy plains. Fine dark soil, like that of the prairies, is found in the treeless plains of southern Russia.
</p>
<p>The eastern half of our country, except portions of the prairies, is quite heavily wooded and yields lumber of many kinds. The forests around the upper three of the Great Lakes consist mostly of pine, spruce and maple, but other kinds of trees also abound there.
</p>
<p>Many streams from this forest region unite and flow past Minneapolis, and that city has grown to be a great lumber market, both for hard woods and soft woods.
</p>
<p>Each year hundreds of thousands of barrels are made in Minneapolis, to hold the flour which the mills there produce. Several branch streams enter the Mississippi below this city and float logs down to the mills in many other river ports.
</p>
<p>Numerous sawmills are located on the small logging rivers which flow from the forests into the Great Lakes. These mills supply lumber to the ports on the lakes.
</p>
 

<pb n="79" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-079" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
<p>Chicago is one of the leading lumber markets of the world.
</p>
<p>This great city is within easy reach of the lake forests and is also a great railroad center. Thus, it can readily supply lumber for buildings in many towns and cities of the almost treeless prairie region.
</p>
<p>Many cities in the Lake region manufacture furniture. Among these Chicago and Grand Rapids rank highest.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-079-a" place="up middle of left column of page"></figure> 
<p>The forests of the Appalachian highland contain both soft-wood and hard-wood trees. Forests of hard-wood trees abound in the states of the Ohio basin and farther south.
</p>
<p>The hard-wood forests in the states which border on the Great Lakes, and the nearness of mines of iron ore and coal, have given this region the lead in the manufacture of agricultural implements, carriages and wagons. The need of these articles in such a rich farming section has also greatly stimulated their manufacture.
</p>
<p>The soft-wood forest belt extends eastward across New York and New England. This eastern portion was long famous for its lumber, but most of the valuable pines have been cut down. At present large numbers of the soft-wood trees are being ground to pulp and made into paper.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-079-b" place="low middle of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Michigan logs a World's Fair, Chicago</hi></figDesc></figure> 
<p>Great forests of hard-wood and soft-wood trees cover a large portion of the Atlantic and Gulf slopes, from the Hudson river to the Rio Grande. Here is found the yellow pine, one of the most valuable trees on the continent. Immense quantities of lumber are sawed from the trunks of the yellow pine in the Southern states, and its sap is made into turpentine, tar, rosin and other naval stores. Savannah exports more naval stores than any other city in the world. Nearly all the seaports of the South export lumber.
</p>
<p>The western slopes of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountains are heavily timbered with soft-wood trees. The cutting of the trees and the sawing of lumber are important industries in many of the cities of the Pacific coast. Along the shores of Puget sound are found some of the largest sawmills in the world. One of the principal trees of the Cascade slopes is the Douglas fir, commonly known as the <hi rend="italic">Oregon pine</hi>. Redwood is one of the most valuable trees of the Coast range, north of San Francisco.
</p>
<p>The United States produces more lumber and manufactures more woodenware and naval stores than any other country in the world.

<p><hi rend="bold">49. Fruit
</hi></p>
<p>The United States is bountifully supplied with fruits. Some of them are widespread in their growth, but others are confined to small areas. Such fruits as peaches, pears, apples, plums and grapes are raised to some extent in nearly all the states of the Union.
</p>
<p>The most important peach areas in the country are in the states between the Hudson river and the Potomac, the southern part of the Atlantic slope in Georgia and South Carolina, eastern Texas, the eastern shores of lake Michigan, and California.
</p>
<p>Small parts of states in other portions of the country produce large crops of peaches, but not so many as the areas named. The states of Georgia and Delaware are specially noted for this fruit, but all the states bordering on Chesapeake and Delaware bays have immense peach orchards. South Carolina is another Southern state that ranks high in the production of this fruit.
</p>
<p>There are several well-known apple areas. One extends from southern Virginia to western North Carolina; another reaches the entire length of the Ohio valley and for quite a distance up the Missouri valley; another is in the district east of lake Michigan; still another stretches from lake Erie eastward to Maine. Arkansas, Virginia, North Carolina and other states also have fine apple areas.
</p>
<p>Pears have about the same distribution as apples.
</p>
<p>Large quantities of grapes grow along the eastern shore of lake Michigan, the southern shore of lake Erie and eastward through the Mohawk valley. The grapes of California are marketed largely in the form of raisins, but great quantities of the fruit are pressed for the juice, which is made into wine.
</p>
 

<pb n="80" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-080" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
<p>Raisins are sun-dried grapes. The curing of the fruit requires very hot and dry weather. A few days of rain in the curing season may spoil a year's crop.
</p>
<p>Southern California and Florida have many orange and <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-080-a" place="up middle of left column of page"></figure>
lemon groves. These states supply the highest grade of oranges in the world.
</p>
<p>Most of the lemons and oranges imported into the United States come from Italy. The West Indies and Central America supply bananas.

<p><hi rend="bold">50. Cattle and Dairy<lb />
Products</hi>
</p>
<p>Cattle are not native to any part of America, but they now thrive in great numbers on the prairies, the Western plains, the pampas, the campos and the llanos, &mdash; in short, wherever there is good grass land.
</p>
<p>There are many cattle in every state in the Union. Most of them are on the prairies, where grass and corn are plentiful, but large numbers are raised on the Southern plains and on the Western plains.
</p>
<p>The great state of Texas raises more cattle than any other state in our country. Illinois ranks second, but in proportion to size ranks first.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-080-c" place="low middle of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Beef room in a packing house</hi></figDesc></figure>
<p>As the population of the Western plains is small, nearly all the cattle raised in that region are sent to the cities farther east, &mdash; to Chicago and Kansas City (Kansas), where the beef is dressed for market. The prairies are more thickly settled, and the cattle of that portion of the country are therefore mostly used near the places where they are raised.
</p>
<p>Not many years ago most of the cattle from the farms and ranches in the Southern states were sent north to be fattened for market in the corn-producing states of the prairies. Now the southern cattle are fattened on the cotton-seed meal and hulls, left after extracting the oil from the seeds. These by-products of the cotton-seed oil industry form the chief food for fattening almost countless cattle.
</p>
<p>The packing of beef, the curing of hides and the making of butter and cheese are very important industries. Chicago is the largest meat market in the world.
</p>
<p>The hides of cattle are tanned and made into leather. One part of the tanning process consists in soaking the hides in water in which certain kinds of bark have been steeped. Hemlock bark is often used, and as hemlock trees abound in Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan and the northern New England states, most of the tanning is done there.
</p>
<p>What are some of the articles made of leather?
</p>
<p>More boots and shoes are made in Massachusetts than in any other state, and Boston is a leading leather market. Philadelphia deals largely in leather.
</p>
<p>Butter, cheese and milk are known as <hi rend="italic">dairy products</hi>. New York ranks first among the dairy states; but milk, butter and cheese are valuable products in nearly all parts of the prairies, as well as in the states farther east.
</p>
<p>The United States exports beef and cattle to Great Britain and Germany. Dairy products and leather also are exported to the same countries.

<p><hi rend="bold">51. Sheep and Wool
</hi></p>
<p>Wool ranks in value and usefulness next to cotton as a cloth making fiber, but in our country more woolen than cotton cloth is made. All the gold and silver ore mined each year in the United States would not pay for the woolen cloth made here in the same time.
</p>
<p>In the United States there are three principal districts in which large numbers of sheep are raised. One of these includes the northern half of the Allegheny plateau and extends westward over the prairies; another is in southwest Texas; the third is in California.
</p>
<p>In our country most of the woolen mills, as well as the cotton mills, are in New England, New York and Pennsylvania.
</p>
 


<pb n="81" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-081" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
<p>In making woolen yarn and cloth, the fibers of wool are put through some of the same processes as the fibers of cotton. They are carded, spun and woven. 
</p>
<p>Boston is the great wool market, because it distributes this fiber to the mills of the New England states. In the manufacture of woolen carpets Philadelphia takes first rank among the cities of the world. 
</p>
<p>In the production of wool the leading regions of the world are eastern Australia and New Zealand, the Plata basin; Great Britain; the steppes of Russia; and the United States.
</p>
<p>Our country and Great Britain must import wool and sheepskins, because they use in their mills and factories more than they produce; but the other regions named above export these products, chiefly to Great Britain, France, Germany and the United States.

</hi></p>
<p>Horses and mules are raised in greatest numbers in the most fertile districts, where there is work for them on the farms. There are about one third as many horses as cattle in our country. The latter far exceed the former in value. 
</p>
<p>Horses were first brought to America by Spanish explorers. These useful animals are now raised in nearly all grassy portions of the New World. Mules also are common in most parts of America, but chiefly in the warmer regions. 
</p>
<p>Many hogs are raised in every state in the Union, but chiefly in the districts which produce the most corn. This grain is the best fattening food for swine. 
</p>
<p>The packing of pork, the curing of hams and the making of lard employ many thousand workmen in our country. The principal pork-packing centers are the large cities of the prairies, more especially Chicago and Kansas City (Kansas).
</p>
<p>Immense quantities of pork, bacon and lard are sent abroad, chiefly to the manufacturing cities of England, Germany and other countries of western Europe.
</p>
<p>The United States produces about as much pork as all Europe.

</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Oysters.</hi> Oysters are salt-water shellfish and are the most valuable food product taken form the shore waters of the United States. The most extensive oyster fisheries in all the world are carried on the Chesapeake bay.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-081-d" place="bottom at middle of page"></figure>
<pb n="82" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-082" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
<p>Several thousand boats and many thousand men are there employed. Smaller oyster beds are found along several other parts of the coast of our country.
</p>
<p>Baltimore is the center of the oyster trade.
</p>
<p>The oyster fisheries are scattered along the coast from Cape Cod to Mexico, &mdash; wherever the sea-bottom is firm. Young oysters die
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-082-a" place="up middle of left column of page"></figure>
unless they attach themselves to hard substances, such as shells, pebbles or larger stones.
</p>
<p>Chesapeake bay yields about four times as many oysters as all the other places on our coasts. Many of the oysters are gathered by means of tongs having long handles. In some places dredges are dragged over the bottom to gather the shellfish.
</p>
<p>In the oyster fisheries France ranks next to the United States. Great Britain also has extensive beds.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Cod and Haddock.</hi> The cod fisheries rank next in importance to the oyster fisheries. The codfish, the had dock and the halibut are caught mostly on <hi rend="italic">banks</hi>, or shoal places in the sea.
</p>
<p>Off the coast of North America the best fishing grounds for cod and haddock are shoal places in the sea, known as the <hi rend="italic">Grand Bank</hi>, southeast of the island of Newfoundland, and <hi rend="italic">Georges Bank</hi>, east of Cape Cod. The halibut is found in about the same places as the codfish. The former is the largest of flatfish and sometimes weighs 100 pounds.
</p>
<p>Most of these fish are caught on hooks hung on long lines that are anchored on the bottom of the sea. Several times a day these lines, called <hi rend="italic">trawls</hi>, are drawn up. The fish are then taken from the hooks, fresh bait is put on and the trawls are again sunk. Some of the fish are carried fresh in ice to market, but large quantities of codfish are cleaned and salted aboard the fishing schooners. When taken ashore the salted codfish are spread out to dry and are later packed in boxes for shipment.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Other Fish and Shellfish.</hi> The clam and the lobster are found along the shores north ward from Chesapeake bay. Both are valuable food products.
</p>
<p>Mackerel migrate in swarms, or <hi rend="italic">schools</hi>, northward along our coasts in spring, and southward in autumn. These fish are caught chiefly in large nets called <hi rend="italic">seines</hi>. Eastern mackerel are taken between cape Hatteras and the gulf of St. Lawrence.
</p>
<p>The salmon fisheries are a very important industry in the rivers of the Pacific coast, northward from San Francisco bay to Alaska. Fish of this kind enter the rivers to spawn, or deposit their eggs. The largest salmon canneries are near the mouth of the Columbia river and along the coast of Alaska.
</p>
<p>The three following paragraphs show where the principal food fishes are taken or caught by fishermen of our country. The fisheries are arranged by regions in the order of value. The list is for <hi rend="italic">reference </hi>only and need not be studied.

<p><hi rend="bold">54. Coal</hi>
</p>
<p>What does lesson 38 tell about the origin of coal fields?
</p>
<p>In the United States there are three very large coal areas and many small ones. The most important coal fields extend along the Appalachian highland; the second begins not far from the southern end of lake Michigan and
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-083-a" place="up middle of left column of page"></figure>  
reaches slightly beyond the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The third is west of the Mississippi and is chiefly in the lower part of the Missouri basin.
</p>
<p>The latter two areas are in beds of rock buried beneath the rich soil of the prairies. The first is in layers of rock, some level and some arched into mountain folds, from the state of Pennsylvania to where the ridges dip under the Gulf coastal plain in Alabama.
</p>
<p>The smaller areas are chiefly in the Rocky mountain states, but there is a good coal field in the Cascade mountains of Washington, and another reaching from Arkansas, through the Indian Territory, into Texas.
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, at the northern end of the Appalachian coal field, supplies more coal than any other state in the Union. Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and Alabama also take very high rank. The latter ranks highest among the Southern states in the production of coal.
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania furnishes nearly all the hard or <hi rend="italic">anthracite </hi>coal mined in the country, as well as a large part of the soft or <hi rend="italic">bituminous </hi>coal. The hard coal is found near the northern end of the ridges known as the Allegheny mountains.
</p>
<p>The coal fields have aided greatly in developing manufactures. Especially in regions having both iron ore and coal, great mills and factories have been built for making all sorts of steel and iron ware.
</p>
<p>The widely scattered coal fields have greatly aided the railroads by supplying fuel for the engines.
</p>
<p>The coal fields of Illinois and other prairie states have been of immense value to the settlers over the wide fertile plains where wood is scarce but where the winters are very cold. The Illinois coal fields have also helped to build up the manufactures of Chicago and other lake ports, all of which can easily obtain iron ore from mines near the shores of lake Superior.
</p>
<p>All the large cities in or near the coal fields are important markets for coal. Among the cities having the largest trade in this product are Philadelphia, Pittsburg and Chicago.
</p>
<p>The countries of western Europe have extensive coal beds and iron mines, and, their people being progressive, they have taken a leading place among the manufacturing countries of the world.
</p>

</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">55. Iron</hi></p>
<p>What does lesson 38 tell about the method of extracting iron and steel from iron ore? About the uses of iron and steel?
</p>
<p>There are four principal iron-ore districts in the United States. These are all mountain regions that have been greatly worn down by rains and streams during long ages, thus laying bare the beds of rock that were once deeply buried.
</p>
<p>The most productive district is near the shores of lake Superior; the other districts are the Allegheny mountains of Pennsylvania and West Virginia; the southern part of the Appalachian highland in Alabama and Tennessee; the Adirondacks of New York.
</p>
<p>Each of the great iron regions is fortunate in being within easy reach of coal fields. The Appalachian region yields both iron ore and coal; the iron ore from the lake Superior region can meet the coal in the ports along the Great Lakes. The principal cities manufacturing iron goods have therefore grown up in the coal and iron districts in the eastern half of the country.
</p>
<p>The iron ore of the lake Superior region is plentiful and pure. <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-083-b" place="low middle of right column of page"></figure>  
It is therefore so valuable that it can compete with other iron ores in their own districts, even though heavy freight charges must be paid to transport it great distances.
</p>
<p>Most of the lake Superior ore is carried by steamers to the various lake ports, but part is sent by rail. The lake ports use only about one third of the ore in their own manufactures. The rest is sent to inland cities, but chiefly to those in the states that border on the Great Lakes.
</p>
<p>Pittsburg, Chicago and Birmingham (Alabama) are the most important iron and steel manufacturing centers in

<p><hi rend="bold">56. Petroleum and Natural Gas
</hi></p>
<p>What does lesson 38 tell about petroleum? About natural gas?
</p>
<p>The two greatest oil fields of the world are at the eastern end of the Caucasus mountains, near the Caspian sea, and near the northern end of the Allegheny plateau, in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia and neighboring states. Southeast Texas has lately developed wells that give a wonderful flow of oil, rivaling the best wells of the world. Smaller fields are found also in southern California, Colorado and other states.
</p>
<p>Most of the crude oil is refined in the cities of Pennsylvania and those on or near New York bay. Large quantities are also refined in Cleveland, on lake Erie. Millions of dollars' worth of oil is sent each year to the countries of western Europe and southeast Asia, mostly through the ports of New York and Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>Long pipes have been laid from the tanks in the oil fields to some of the cities in which petroleum is refined. Some of these pipes are hundreds of miles in length. The oil is forced through them by means of powerful pumps.
</p>
<p>A large amount of oil is transported in great tanks placed on cars. Much of it is also shipped in bulk in barges or steamers.
</p>
<p>The petroleum exported each year from the United States is of greater value than the gold mined here in the same time.
</p>
<p>In the oil fields of the northern part of the Allegheny plateau, and extending somewhat beyond their limits, is found natural gas. This gas, like petroleum, is obtained by sinking pipes down to layers of porous rock in which the gas and the oil are stored up by nature.
</p>
<p>The most valuable gas wells in the United States are in Pennsylvania, Indiana and Ohio. In many cities in the gas fields the low cost of gas as a fuel has caused very rapid growth in manufactures.
</p>
<p>Natural gas is often carried great distances in pipes and is used for heating purposes. A large part of the gas used for heating purposes in Chicago is piped from the gas fields of Indiana.

<p>57. Gold, Silver, Copper, Lead and Zinc
</p>
<p>What does lesson 38 tell about gold? About silver?
</p>
<p>The richest gold mines in the world are in the Western highland of our country; the mountains of southeast Australia; southern Africa; the Ural mountains between Russia proper and. Siberia. Alaska and the portion of Canada in the Yukon basin, a little east of the Alaskan boundary, have very rich gold fields. The Canadian gold region is known as the <hi rend="italic">Klondike region</hi>.
</p>
<p>The Rocky mountains in Colorado and the Sierra Nevada in California and Nevada yield most of the gold mined in this country, though all the states of the Western highland have valuable gold mines.
</p>
<p>Lesser quantities of gold are found in the southern Appalachians.
</p>
<p>America supplies most of the silver used in the world. The principal regions are the Western highland of the United States, the plateau of Mexico and the countries of the middle Andes.
</p>
<p>About two thirds of the silver ore mined in this country come from the Rocky mountains in Colorado and Montana. The states of the Great Basin also take high rank in the production of silver ore.
</p>
<p>The value of the gold and silver mined in this country is very great, but not nearly so great as that of either the corn, the wheat or the cotton.
</p>
<p>What does lesson 38 tell about the uses of copper?
</p>
<p>The United States leads all other countries in the production of copper. The most valuable 'mines are in Michigan, Montana and Arizona.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-085-a" place="low middle of left column of page"></figure>
<p>England purchases great quantities of the copper mined in the United States.
</p>
<p>One of the chief uses of copper is to make wires for conducting currents of electricity from power houses to cars, lights and electric machinery; also telephone wires.
</p>
<p>What does lesson 38 say about lead and zinc?
</p>
<p>Most of the lead produced in our country comes from ores of silver mined in the Rocky mountains.
</p>
<p>Large quantities of zinc and lead are obtained from ores in the Mississippi valley, especially in Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin. The United States and Germany lead in the output of lead and zinc.

as well as in our own and other highly civilized countries, it is perhaps safe to say that rice is more widely used for food than any other grain.
</p>
<p>In the United States millions of bushels of rice are raised in the swampy or marshy lands of the delta and flood plains of the lower Mississippi, and neighboring streams, especially in Louisiana and eastern Texas; also in the wet lands of river swamps and coastal marshes of South Carolina and Georgia. Great quantities are exported from all these states.
</p>
<p>What does lesson 32 tell about the culture of rice?
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Sugar.</hi> The delta and flood plains of the lower Mississippi region, especially in Louisiana, produce nearly all the sugar cane raised in the United States proper; but the Hawaiian islands and Porto Rico send great quantities of brown sugar to this country. Most of the cane sugar used here comes from Cuba.
</p>
<p>In Europe, and to a much smaller extent in some parts of this country, sugar is made from the juice of beets. Immense numbers of sugar beets are raised in the plains on the north, east and west of the Alpine highland. This kind of sugar has almost wholly taken the place of cane sugar in the markets of Europe.
</p>
<p>California and Michigan supply more than half of the beet sugar made in this country. Austria, Germany, France, Russia and other countries of Europe produce many times as much as the United States.
</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Early Vegetables.</hi> The Atlantic coast states, from Delaware to Georgia and Florida, send north immense quantities of fresh vegetables before the gardens of the northern states yield their crops. Texas raises early vegetables and fruits for the cities of the upper Mississippi valley.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Building Stone.</hi> Many large cities establish fire limits" within which all new buildings must be made of stone or brick, unless a special permit is given to build of other material. This is to lessen the danger from fires. Most of the new large buildings in cities have frames of steel, which support not only the roof and floors, but also to a very large extent the stone or brickwork of the walls.
</p>
<p>The places from which building stone is taken acre called <hi rend="italic">quarries</hi>. The principal kinds of building stone are limestone, marble, granite, sandstone and slate. Brick clay is also of great value. What does lesson 38 tell about each of these kinds of building stone?
</p>
<p>Limestone is the most widely used building stone quarried in the United States. The principal limestone region extends in a broad belt from New England to Missouri, but Pennsylvania and Illinois quarry the most stone of this kind.
</p>
<p>Vermont supplies more than half the marble quarried in the Union. Tennessee, New York and Georgia also produce large quantities of beautiful marble.
</p>
<p>The most and the best granite is quarried in New England. Massachusetts and Maine supply, more than any other two states.
</p>
<p>The largest amount of sandstone comes from the Allegheny plateau in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Much of this stone is there made into glass.
</p>
<p>Pennsylvania yields more than half the roofing and flagging or sidewalk slate used in this country; but Vermont also has large slate quarries.

<p><hi rend="bold">59. Wild Animals of United States and Alaska
</hi></p>
<p>Large herds of bison, often called <hi rend="italic">buffaloes</hi>, at one time grazed on the plains and prairies east of the Rocky mountains; but the white hunters and Indians have killed millions of them, and only a few small herds are now known to exist.
</p>
<p>Countless deer also at one time grazed on the plains with the bison. Great numbers of these also have been killed, but many are still found in the forests and some wooded ranges of hills and mountains.
</p>
<p>Thousands of reindeer, called <hi rend="italic">caribou</hi>, feed on grass, moss and tender branches in the cold plains of the far north, in Canada and parts of Alaska.
</p>
<p>In the soft-wood forest belt in the cooler part of . the temperate zone lives the great animal called the <hi rend="italic">moose</hi>, the largest of the deer family. It feeds on leaves and branches. This animal is noted, not only for its size, but also for its speed and its broad flat antlers.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-086-a" place="up left of right column of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Slate quarry</hi></figDesc></figure>
<p>Millions of small furbearing animals live in the soft-wood forest belt that extends from. the northern part of the United States across Canada to Alaska.
</p>
<p>There the cunning beaver feeds on berries, leaves and bark, and for safety builds its but at the edge of a lake or a river. The watchful otter follows the streams, looking for fish. The sable and many other little fur bearers also make this region their home. The finest and best furs in the world come from the cold parts of the north temperate zone.
</p>
<p>Among the animals of the great highland in the western part of North America are the fierce grizzly bear, the catlike puma and the graceful bighorn, or Rocky mountain sheep. Black bears and brown bears also are found in the large forest regions of this continent.
</p>
<p>Many domestic fowl are found in nearly all places where the white man has settled in America, but most of them are natives of the Old World and, like the cattle, have been brought to America by the white 'man. The turkey, however, is a native bird of America. Large eagles build their nests in some of the mountain regions.
</p>
<p>Alligators may be seen swimming in some of the streams and lagoons of the warmer part of the United States and the tropical lands farther south. Many are killed for their skins, from which fine leather is made.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-086-b" place="low middle of page"><figDesc><hi rend="bold">Granite quarry</hi></figDesc></figure>
<p>Large quantities of food fish are caught in the shore waters of the United States and Alaska, and also in the large lakes and streams. Fishing gives work to many thousand men.
</p>
<p>The white or polar bear, the largest of the bear family, is found in the Arctic regions of Alaska, as well as nearly all other lands bordering on the Arctic ocean. These bears are sometimes killed by Eskimos; the flesh is then eaten, and the skin is made into clothing. This great bear feeds chiefly on seals and fish. It is never found far from the sea in which its food lives.
</p>

<p>Seals and walruses are common on the ice fields and in the icy sea.
</p>
<p>Seals feed chiefly on fish that they catch with their sharp claws. They swim with great speed, but are clumsy on the land. Some seals are highly valued for their fine furs. Seals form a large part of the food of Eskimos.
</p>
<p>The most famous fishing ground for seals is on the chain of islands stretching from the peninsula of Alaska to the northeast part of Asia, partly inclosing the large sea that connects with the Arctic ocean through Bering strait. In the summer large herds of seals visit these islands to feed and rear their young. Many are then killed for their fur. Thousands also are destroyed while swimming in the sea; many of the latter sink and are lost.
</p>
<p>Whales are found in the icy Arctic waters. Many were formerly killed for their blubber, from which oil was obtained by heating; but fewer are now needed, as petroleum, gas and electricity have largely taken the place of whale oil for lighting purposes.
</p>
<p>One kind of whale has a large sieve along each side of its mouth. This sieve is made of blades of horn called <hi rend="italic">whalebone</hi>. By means of the sieves the whale gathers its food from the sea water which it takes into its mouth. More than 2000 pounds of whalebone have been taken from the mouth of a single whale.
</p>
<p>The blubber of the so-called <hi rend="italic">sperm whale</hi> yields valuable sperm oil. This species of whale is found in the three oceans of the torrid zone and the warmer parts of the temperate zones. The sperm whale has teeth and in this regard is unlike the whalebone whale. The former sometimes grows to the length of over 60 feet and its body may yield more than 100 barrels of oil.
</p>
<p>Among the smaller animals of the Arctic region are white foxes and hares.
</p>
<p>During the short Arctic summer myriads of sea fowl visit the shores of the cold seas to build their nests and catch food. Among these are ducks, geese and auks. The Eskimos kill many of the birds for food and use the soft feathers in making clothing and beds. The eggs also are used for food.
</p>
<p>One kind of duck that builds its nest in the far north is the eider duck. This bird lines its nest with soft feathers plucked from its breast. These fluffy feathers are gathered and sold as <hi rend="italic">eider down</hi>.

<p><hi rend="bold">60. Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,<lb />
Rhode Island, Connecticut<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-088-1" n="1"></note>
</hi></p>
<p>The northern and western parts of New England are very hilly or mountainous. The highest lands are the peaks of the White mountains in New Hampshire, with Mt. Washington as the crowning height. Many hills and low ranges extend across northern Maine, turning most of the streams southward. Farther west the Green mountains form a backbone for the state of Vermont and join the Hoosac range, which dies away southward in ridges of hills in Connecticut.
</p>
<p>The rest of New England, except some parts along the coast or in the river valleys, consists in general of hilly
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-088-a" place="middle of page"></figure>
uplands. Far from the coast, where the uplands are high, the streams have worn deep valleys; but nearer the coast the land in general is not so high.
</p>
<p>Along many of the streams there are fertile meadows or flood plains, and broad marshes have formed along some parts of the coast.
</p>
<p>The rivers show how the land slopes. The northern and western parts of Vermont slope towards lake Champlain or northward to the St. Lawrence valley. Between the Green and the White mountains lies the long fertile valley of the Connecticut river, sloping to Long Island sound. Farther east, the Merrimac, Kennebec and Penobscot rivers show that the general slope of the country is southward, though some of the smaller streams flow to the southeast.
</p>
<p>New England has thousands of useful lakes and swift streams. They have done much towards building up the industries of this section, but to learn how they were formed we must study abouta vast sheet of ice that once spread over this land.
</p>
<p>Long ages ago the climate of New England, as well as of all the states westward around the Great Lakes and also Canada, was so
<note id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-088-1" n="1">The map studies on page 90 should precede this lesson.
</note>
cold that the summer sun could not melt away the winter snow. It was like winter all the year, just as it is now in the cold lands of the far north. After many years the snow became very deep. Part of the snow under the heavy mass was changed to solid ice, and an ice sheet was formed, perhaps thousands of feet deep.
</p>
<p>The sheet of ice slowly moved towards the sea, pushing the soil along and grinding the surface of outcropping rocks. Such a great mass of ice could easily fill the valleys and crowd out the rivers.
</p>
<p>At length the climate became warmer, and the ice sheet slowly melted away, leaving the gravel, sand and finer soil in great heaps or spread out roughly in plains. In some places the gravel and sand were left in ridges directly across river valleys; and when the ice melted back far enough to let streams run in the valleys, such ridges held back the water and formed lakes. Nearly all the thousands of lakes in New England were formed in this way, back of ridges of sand and gravel left by the melting ice in the river valleys.
</p>
<p>Most of the rivers that were pushed out of their valleys by the ice found their valleys so clogged with gravel, when the ice melted back, that they could not again flow in the same places. Many of them flowed in new channels down steep slopes, forming rapids; or over cliffs, forming falls. Thus we find that the rivers of this section contain many rapids and falls, affording water power that has made New England famous for its manufactures. The lakes are great storehouses of water, and they help to keep an even flow in the rivers in times of drouth.
</p>
<p>At about the time when the heavy ice sheet was over this part of the country the coast line of New England, as well as that of all Canada, slowly settled in the sea. The salt water partly filled many valleys of the rough land, but left the tops of the ridges standing out as peninsulas or islands. This is the reason why the coast is so irregular, and why there are so many deep and safe harbors.
</p>
<p>After the sheet of ice melted it must have taken a long time for the common plants from warmer parts of the country to spread their seeds over the barren land, and for great trees to drop their seeds and grow farther and farther northward; but at length large
 

<pb n="89" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-089" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
portions of New England were forested, while rich grasses grew in the river valleys and on the uplands.</p>
<p>The falls and rapids in nearly all the large streams of New England were early used for water power. More mill wheels are turned by the Merrimac and Blackstone rivers than by any other two rivers in the world. There are also many great mills on the Connecticut river and its branches, and on the rivers of Maine. These mills make cloth, paper and countless other articles. Many cities of New England manufacture boots and shoes; others fine cutlery, hardware, bicycles, clocks, firearms and nearly all kinds of silverware and brass goods. Steam has now largely taken the place of water power from streams, coal for fuel being chiefly from Pennsylvania; but the costly machinery and skilled workmen of New England still hold a large portion of the manufacturing industry to this section, although it is far from many of the regions that produce the cotton, wool, hides, iron ore and other kinds of raw material.
</p>
<p>New England has the severe winters and the warm or hot summers of the cooler part of the north temperate zone. Plentiful rains fall in the storms of the westerly winds. When the wind blows from the south, from over the Gulf stream, even the days of midwinter become mild or warm; but when winds blow from over the polar current that flows along the east coast, the weather becomes chilly, and in winter often brings a heavy fall of snow. In summer these winds afford relief from the strong heat.
</p>
<p>New England has some fertile river valleys and upland farms. The

Connecticut valley yields large quantities of tobacco. Nearly all parts of this section produce garden vegetables, and such fruits as apples and pears. There are excellent grass lands, and New England ranks high for its dairy products.
</p>
<p>The forests of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont were once the chief source of lumber for the Atlantic states, but now the timber forests are fewer. Much of the soft wood of the trees is ground to pulp and used in making paper. Vermont is famous for its maple sugar.
</p>
<p>The quarries of this group of states are very valuable. They yield immense quantities of granite, marble, slate

and sand stone. Many fish are cought off the shores of New England.
</p>
<p>Seaports have grown group of states. These ports, as well as many railroad centers, receive the raw material for the mills and factories and then ship away the manufactured goods. Railroads extend from New England to nearly all parts of the country.

<p>So many poets and other writers have lived in or near Boston, and so many fine schools of all classes and grades, as well as libraries and art galleries, have been founded there, that Boston is often called the <hi rend="italic">Athens of America</hi>.
</p>
<p>Boston owes its growth very largely to the fact that here the railroads from the west reach the chief harbor on the New England coast. Among American cities Boston ranks second in foreign commerce.

<p>The surface of this group of states may be studied in four belts running northeast and southwest. First there is the mountain belt for a backbone; along the west side of the mountains extends the Allegheny plateau; on the east of the mountains is the rough foothill region (often called <hi rend="italic">piedmont</hi>, meaning <hi rend="italic">foothills</hi>), in the highest part of the Atlantic slope; along the coast and reaching to the foothill region is the true coastal plain, quite low and level.</p>

<p>The Adirondacks are, cut off from the rest of the Appalachian highland by the valley of the
Mohawk river on the south, and the valley of lakes George and Champlain on the east.</p>
<p>The Mohawk valley is only about 100 miles long, but is one of the most important valleys in the world, as it opens a highway of trade directly through the Appalachian highland and connects the coast with the fertile prairie region, by way of the Great Lakes or railroad routes. </p>
<p>This valley also made possible the digging of the Erie canal, about three quarters of a century ago. Before railroads were built to reach the prairie states, as well as afterwards, this canal carried an immense amount of freight, turning it chiefly to New York,Mohawk river and Erie canal
thus helping to give this city railroad lines along this valley the lead in commerce. Later the turned down the Hudson to New

York, though other lines were built to connect with the New England states. The canal is still very useful.</p>
<p>The lake valley on the east of the Adirondacks forms a highway northward, but not so important as the Mohawk valley,because the northern lands are not nearly so productive as the western. Both these valleys unite with that of the Hudson river. During past ages this river has cut a deep gorge. Its bluffs, called palisades, are famous for their beauty. The Hudson valley has settled so that the tides are felt far up the navigable part of the river.</p>
<p>Railroads are now the principal means of trade between the coast and the inland country. They pass the highland, not only through the Hudson-Mohawk valley, but also over more rugged regions farther south, giving more direct routes of trade westward from Philadelphia, Baltimore and other cities.
</p>
<p>The most valuable part of the Appalachian highland in these states consists of the many parallel ridges forming the Allegheny mountains, reaching southwest through Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and the extreme west of Virginia.</p>
<p>Most of the Allegheny mountains were formed as long folds, one of which is shown on page 9. Some of these folds remain, but most of them have been greatly worn by rain and streams. Many layers of rock once buried have been laid bare by the wearing away of layers above them. It is in such deep layers, brought nearer the surface by the folding and the wearing away by water, that many of the richest beds of coal and of iron ore are found in these states. The Allegheny mountains are one of the richest fields for iron ore and coal in the world.

ridge is a long valley, part of which is known as the Shenandoah valley. It is noted for its beauty and the richness of its soil.</p>
<p>Most of the Shenandoah valley has been worn in soft limestone. Water slowly dissolves this rock and forms caves or caverns. There are many places in the Appalachian highland where limestone caves are made. The caverns of Luray, in the Shenandoah valley, are among the most beautiful. Mammoth cave, in Kentucky, was formed in the same way and is much larger.</p>

<p>The roofs of caves sometimes fall in, making deep gorges; or a small part of the roof may remain standing in the form of an arch. The Natural Bridge, shown in one of the pictures below, is in the long valley west of the Blue ridge. This rocky arch is over 200 feet high; it was once part of the roof of a cave.</p>
<p>The Allegheny plateau includes all the portion of these states west of the Allegheny mountains, and reaches eastward across northern Pennsylvania and southern New York as far as the Catskill mountains. <hi rend="italic">See map on page 70.</hi></p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-093-a" place="in the middle of the page"><figDesc>Typical scene in the Allegheny plateau, west of the Allegheny mountains</figDesc></figure>
<p>The many streams flowing across the Allegheny plateau to join the Ohio river have cut hundreds of deep valleys, making travel very difficult except in the valleys themselves. Most of the higher parts of this plateau are heavily forested. One of the pictures on this page gives an excellent view of the plateau region in West Virginia.
</p>
<p>The rocky layers of the plateau contain rich beds of soft coal and iron ore. The many valleys cut by streams expose these valuable beds on the slopes, so that they can be easily found and mined. Petroleum and natural gas abound, greatly favoring manufactures in the western part of this group of states.</p>
<p>Along the east side of the Blue ridge and the lower ranges farther northeast lies the foothill region. It is the belt where the mountains gradually descend to hills, and these to the coastal plain
farther east. The foothill region, as its name implies, is rough, but its upland
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-093-b" place="in the bottom of the page"><figDesc>Natural Bridge, Virginia
</figDesc></figure>
tobacco, grain and fruits.</p>
<p>Along the line where the foothill region blends with the smoother coastal plain there are falls and rapids that give fine water power. This line where the two regions join is called the fall-line. It extends from the Hudson river, along the inner edge of the coastal plain to and around the southern end of the Appalachians, and has exerted much influence in developing
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-093-c" place="in the right bottom of the page"><figDesc>Limestone caverns in Virginia</figDesc></figure>
manufactures. It is also the line which marks the head of navigation and the beginning of deeper
tide water in many of the larger sluggish rivers of the coastal plain. <hi rend="bold">See picture of fall line on page 99.</hi> </p>
<p>Along the fall-line have grown many great cities, such as Trenton, Baltimore, Richmond
and Petersburg, in this group of states, as well as many in the states farther south. These
cities, of course, owe their growth largely to other causes, such as their positions on harbors
and railroad lines.
</p>
<p>The coastal plain crosses the eastern side of all the Atlantic states southward from Long Island. The part near the sea is in most places very low and level; but farther inland where the plains rise higher the streams have cut deeper valleys, between which spread broad fertile uplands.
</p>
<p>Great forests cover parts of the Atlantic slope. Other parts in this group of states produce peaches, apples and other fruits.
</p>

<p>One of the finest peanut regions in the world reaches from the James river, Virginia, southward into North Carolina. The foothill region, or piedmont, in these two states is famous for its fine apples.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to make roads in many parts of the coastal plain where the soil is clayey or sandy. Some of the clay is made into fine pottery, and some of the sand makes excellent glass.
</p>
<p>In lesson 6 we learned that coastal plains are smooth sea-bottoms lifted up to form dry land; this means that the sea once stood over the land that now forms the Atlantic coastal plain. The old shore line was where the <hi rend="italic">fall-line</hi> now lies along the lower edge of the foothill region. Many shells of creatures that can live only in the salt sea water are found in the coastal plain.
</p>
<p>For a long time after the sea-bottom rose to form the coastal plain the rain and streams wore valleys in its surface. Then for some reason the lower part of the plain settled again under the sea and let the salt water flow into some of the valleys, making fine bays, such as Chesapeake. Delaware and New York bays. These arms of the sea are of great value in commerce, and near their heads have grown up the great cities of New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore. Near the entrance of the Chesapeake is also the deep and sheltered harbor of Norfolk.
</p>
<p>In some parts of the coastal plain are great swamps covering hundreds of square miles. Cypress trees thrive in many of the swamps. One of the pictures on page 98 shows part of the Dismal swamp, southwest of the entrance to Chesapeake bay. This swamp is partly in Virginia and partly in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The many beautiful lakes in New York state were nearly all formed in the same way as those of New England, by the blocking of valleys with gravel and sand left by the ice sheet when it melted back. The largest of these lakes, Oneida, Cayuga and Seneca, as well as the river Mohawk, were given the names of tribes of fierce and warlike Indians that long held the Mohawk valley and the region farther west towards lake Erie.</p>
<p>Between western New York and Canada the Niagara river forms the outlet of lake Erie. This river flows over a high cliff, making the grand falls of Niagara.</p>
<p>Long ago Niagara river fell over a bluff much nearer lake Ontario than at present, but the stream has slowly cut a deep gorge back six miles into this bluff. The falls of Niagara are about three fourths of a mile wide and 150 feet high. Below the falls the river rushes through its long gorge, making rapids of great size and beauty.</p>
<p>The rock under the falls consists of layers of limestone resting on softer rock. From time to time, as the lower rock is worn back at its front under the falls, huge masses of limestone break off and plunge down into the gorge, thus moving the falls slowly back upstream. The river 
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-094-a" place="in the middle of the page"><figDesc>Falls of Niagara
</figDesc></figure>must have worked thousands of years to form this great gorge.
</p>

<p>A small part of the water of Niagara river is led aside and made to turn great water wheels that run machines making electricity. This is carried along wires to many of the cities and towns of western New York and there used to light streets and buildings, as well as to run electric cars or supply power to engines in mills and workshops.
</p>
<p>The Welland canal carries vessels between lakes Erie and Ontario, avoiding the Niagara river. This canal is in Canada.

<p>NEW YORK. <hi rend="bold">New York</hi> is the second city in population in the world. Nearly 3,500,000 people live in this city.</p>
<p>The city of New York now consists of five sections called <hi rend="italic">boroughs; </hi>the boroughs of Manhattan and Bronx, which correspond with the old city of New York, the borough of Brooklyn, the borough of Queens and the borough of Richmond.</p>
<p>Two years after the first permanent  settlement made by English people in America, at Jamestown, Virginia (1607), an English captain named <hi rend="italic">Henry Hudson, </hi>with a Dutch crew, all in the employ of Holland, sailed up the Hudson river about as far  as  the place where Albany has since
been built. Several years afterwards the Dutch built a fort on the upper Hudson, near Albany, and later sent a colony that settled on Manhattan island, where part of the city of New York now stands, but where at that time there was only a small trading post. Dutch settlers also crossed to Long Island and laid out farms where Brooklyn has since grown up.</p>
<p>England, however, claimed these lands settled by the Dutch, because English sailors had gone along the coast a few years after the first voyage of Columbus to the New World. The stronger nation won, and the English flag was raised over the colonies.</p>
<p>New York, like all the other great Atlantic seaports, is joined with the interior by several trunk lines of railroads. This city carries on more than half the foreign trade of our country.</p>
<p>The chief exports from New York are meats, cotton, petroleum, wheat and flour. Most of these are sent to Great Britain and other countries of western Europe.</p>
<p>The principal imports of New York are: cloth from England, Germany and France; coffee from Brazil and other parts of tropical America; cane sugar from the West Indies, and beet sugar from Germany; tin plate from England; rubber from Brazil; tea from China and Japan.</p>
<p>New York is the greatest manufacturing center in America. The total value of the manufactures of this city is greater than that of all imports into our country.
The great value and variety of the articles made in this city may be judged from the fact that there are more than one hundred industries each of which yields products ranging in value from $1,000,000 to nearly $150,000,000 each year. The most important manufactures are various articles of clothing, books, cigars, leather goods and furniture. More books, magazines and newspapers are published in New York than in any other city of the New World.</p>
<p>New York and Jersey City prepare great quantities of meat for home and foreign markets.</p>
<p>Columbia University is in the city of New York. This city also has great libraries and art galleries.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Brooklyn</hi>, a borough of New York city, contains about 1,000,000 people. This borough is joined to the borough of Manhattan by the largest suspension bridge in the w o rid <hi rend="italic">(see picture on page 92), </hi>and a second great bridge joining these boroughs is now being constructed.

There are large forests in northern Pennsylvania, yielding good bark for tanning leather; many tanneries have been built in Philadelphia. This seaport refines great quantities of sugar and molasses.</p>
<p>There are great cotton mills and oil refineries in
this city. Along the river front in and near Philadelphia are immense shipyards. Most of the new iron ships of our navy were built here.</p>
<p>The foreign trade of Philadelphia is very large. The city ranks third in population among American cities.</p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania is in Philadelphia. Here also is the Independence Hall, in which the Declaration of Independence was signed, and where may still be seen the old bell that first rang out the news that the Declaration had been passed.</p>

<p>MARYLAND. <hi rend="bold">Baltimore</hi> is on a fine harbor about forty miles from the head of Chesapeake bay. The foreign commerce of this city has grown rapidly in recent years.</p>
<p>Baltimore is almost surrounded by fruit districts. It is a leading market for the large tobacco crop of Maryland and other states further south. The long grain belt from lake Ontario to Chesapeake bay includes the country around Baltimore. This bay supplies more oysters than are taken from any other equal area in the world.</p>
<p>With these natural advantages, Baltimore takes high rank in the canning and shipping of fruit and oysters, and in the manufacture of tobacco articles and flour.</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins University is in this city.</p>
<p>We have seen that the Puritans and the Quakers came to America to find freedom of worship. For the same purpose a colony of <hi rend="italic">Roman Catholics </hi>left England and settled on the banks of the Potomac in Maryland.

a few miles above Mt. Vernon, his home on the banks of the Potomac river. In order that the capital of the country might be free from all state control Maryland gave the land where the city of Washington and its suburb, Georgetown, have been built. This area is known as the <hi rend="italic">District of Columbia</hi>.

<p>Washington is chiefly a city of residences and public offices. It is the seat of the Smithsonian and the Carnegie Institutions.</p>
<p>VIRGINIA. Richmond ranks next to New York and St. Louis in the manufacture of tobacco articles. Richmond is also a leading market for leaf tobacco. This city has a large shipbuilding plant and one of the largest wooden-ware factories in the world.</p>
<p>Richmond is at the head of tide water on the James and has an active coasting trade.</p>
<p>Richmond is the capital of a state that has given to the nation many famous patriots, for example, Washington, who commanded the army during the Revolutionary war, and Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration of Independence.

<div type="section"><head>SOUTHERN STATES,&mdash;EASTERN SECTION</head>
<p><hi rend="bold">64. North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee</hi></p>
<p>The eastern section of the Southern states has regions similar to those of the Middle Atlantic group, but with much wider and more fertile coastal plains. It is in the warm half of the north temperate zone. These states receive heavy rainfall from moist winds that blow from over the gulf of Mexico. The summers are long and hot; the winters are short and mild, except along the northern border.The Blue ridge crosses from Virginia into North Carolina. In the western part of the latter
state rise the Black mountains, with Mt. Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Rocky mountains. Other lower ranges of the Appalachian highland occupy the
western part of the Carolinas, eastern Tennessee and northern Georgia and Alabama. Gold is found in the mountains of these states, but not nearly so much as in the Western highland. Georgia and Tennessee have quarries of fine marble.
</p>
<p>West of these mountains lies the southern part of the Allegheny <hi rend="italic">plateau</hi>, but it is here so deeply cut by streams that it takes the name of Cumberland <hi rend="italic">mountains</hi>. The

<pb n="99" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-099" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
rich beds of iron ore and coal in this region are being rapidly developed, and many large iron foundries and mills have been built. Alabama and Tennessee take high rank as iron-producing states.</p>
<p>Around the southern and eastern sides of the Appalachian highland spreads the foothill region, as in the states farther north. This region is deeply cut by river valleys. Its soil is perfectly suited to the growth of cotton, yellow-pine forests and fruits. The Carolinas have also fine tobacco areas.</p>
<p>Cotton is the leading product of the soil in the Southern states <hi rend="italic">See lesson 43.</hi>In nearly every city of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama there are cotton mills.</p>
<p>The western part of North Carolina produces apples that have no superior in the world. One of the best peach areas extends from Georgia far into South Carolina. Georgia is noted for its large crop of peanuts.</p>
<p>Along the lower edge of the foothill slopes runs the fallline, giving fine water power to many cities. East and south of the foothills the coastal plain reaches to the sea.</p>
<p>As in Virginia and other states farther north, the inland portion of the coastal plain is somewhat rolling or hilly, being cut by streams; but the portion nearer the sea is low and in many places swampy.</p>
<p>Sand bars built by waves stretch along the coast and partly inclose many sounds. Inlets through the bars are kept open by currents caused by the ebb and flow of tides.</p>
<p>The shallow waters along the shore afford few landing places for large vessels, but good harbors are found in the river mouths or as far up the streams as strong tides are felt.</p>
<p>Large quantities of rice are raised in the wet lands of the coastal plain,&mdash;in swamps inside sand bars and along the rivers where the lands may at times be flooded or drained. South Carolina and Georgia are among the leading states in the culture of rice.</p>
<p>There are important oyster fisheries along the coast of Georgia and Florida.
</p>
<p>The coastal plain spreads far up the Mississippi valley, to the mouth of the Ohio river.<hi rend="italic"> See map on page 70. </hi>The entire region, except the poorer coast lands and forested areas, produces immense quantities of cotton. Corn is also a very important product in all these states. Tennessee and North Carolina raise large crops of wheat.</p>
<p>Nearly all parts of the Southern states were at one time wooded, and forests still cover the greater part of the region. The yellow pine is one of the most important lumber trees and also yields great quantities of naval stores. <hi rend="italic">See lesson 33.</hi> This is one of the principal lumber districts of the world.
</p>
<p>The peninsula of Florida, lying between the gulf and the ocean, is formed mostly of coastal plain, but is also in part the work of coral polyps. Tiny creatures of this kind are still very active in building the southern portion of the peninsula farther out into the warm Gulf stream that runs between Florida and Cuba. The southern part of Florida contains a great swamp, called the <hi rend="italic">Everglades</hi>. This state raises fine oranges.
</p>
<p>The western part of Mississippi, especially the part drained by the Yazoo river, is in the low and fertile flood plain of the Mississippi river. The soil is fine and deep, and yields immense crops of cotton and sugar cane. <hi rend="italic">See picture on page 78.</hi></p>

<p>NORTH CAROLINA. <hi rend="bold">Wilmington</hi>, the largest city, has a good harbor on the tidal waters of the Cape Fear river. The principal exports are cotton and tobacco from the uplands; and lumber, rosin and turpentine from the yellow-pine forests of the broad coastal plain.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Raleigh</hi>, the capital, is in the cotton and tobacco district. This is one of the many southern cities having cotton mills. </p>

<p>This city was named for the famous Englishman, <hi rend="italic">Sir Walter Raleigh</hi>, who tried to plant colonies in <hi rend="italic">Carolina</hi>,as the lands from Virginia almost to St. Augustine were once called.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Charlotte</hi> is an important railroad center, and therefore a market for the products of the surrounding district. This city is growing very rapidly.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Asheville</hi> is a beautiful mountain resort and is an important trade district.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Durham</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Winston</hi> are centers of a large tobacco trade.</p>
<p>SOUTH CAROLINA. <hi rend="bold">Charleston</hi> has a fine harbor and is the chief seaport of South Carolina. Charleston takes high rank in the export of cotton and rice.</p>
<p>Fifty years after the Pilgrims landed in Plymouth,an English colony settled near the present site of Charleston and a little later moved to the site where the city now stands. The people of this colony began the culture of rice in this country.
Some years later they raised with great success the dye plant indigo and still later the cotton plant, which has now become the chief source of wealth in the South. </p>
<p>Near Charleston, and in the river bottoms and marshy lands farther south, is found a kind of rock known as <hi rend="italic">phosphate rock</hi>. Large quantities of it are as phosphate rock. Large quantities of it are prepared for use as a fertilizer.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Columbia</hi>, the capital, is the railroad center of the state and the seat of the State University.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Spartanburg</hi> is the center of the cotton-manufacturing industry of the state. <hi rend="bold">Greenville</hi> is a beautiful health resort.</p>
<p>GEORGIA. In <hi rend="bold">Atlanta</hi>, the capital and largest city, several railroads from the Atlantic coastal plain meet others from the Mississippi valley. This city is therefore a trade center for nearly the export of rosin and turpenine. 
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Savannah</hi> was founded by an English colony, the year after Washington was born.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Augusta, Macon </hi>and <hi rend="bold">Columbus</hi> are not only important markets for southern products, but they also have large cotton mills.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Valdosta</hi> is the largest inland market for Sea-island cotton in the world.</p>
<p>FLORIDA. <hi rend="bold">Jacksonville</hi>, the largest city in Florida, has a large trade in lumber and oranges and is also a well-known winter resort.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Key West</hi>, the second city in size, is on a coral island. The chief manufacture in this city and in <hi rend="bold">Tampa</hi> is cigars made of Cuban tobacco.<lb />

<p><hi rend="bold">Birmingham</hi> is situated in the coal and iron district near the southern end of the Appalachian highland. This city and <hi rend="bold">Ensley</hi>, near by, have extensive manufactures of iron and steel.</p>
<p>The Birmingham district now ranks third among the great iron and steel manufacturing districts of the country. Iron ore, coal and limestone are there found within short distances of the country of one another, greatly cheapening the cost of manufacture of the metal. In the addition to huge blast furnaces and foundries, the Birmingham district has large steel mills in operation. Ensley, a few miles from Birmingham, has the largest steel mill in the South.

<p><hi rend="bold">Huntsville</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Selma</hi> are two of the many cities having cotton mills. The former takes the lead in cotton manufacturing in the state.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Montgomery</hi>, the capital, has a large trade in cotton.</p>
<p>MISSISSIPPI.<hi rend="bold"> Vicksburg</hi>, the largest city, is one of the trade centers that have been built on the bluffs of the Mississippi. This city is one of the important cotton markets on the great river.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Natchez</hi>, farther downstream, is another city making large shipments of cotton.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Meridian</hi> ships much of the cotton of the eastern part of the state. <hi rend="bold">Jackson</hi> is the capital.</p>
<p>TENNESSEE. <hi rend="bold">Nashville</hi>, the capital, is in a region where both cotton and tobacco are produced. Large areas in Tennessee are covered with forests. Nashville is a market for cotton, lumber and tobacco.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Memphis </hi>is the largest cotton market in the state and the most important river port between St. Louis and New Orleans. Memphis is also a railroad center. Much of the cotton sent from this city goes by rail to New York or to other cities in the northeast part of our country, where there are many cotton mills.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Chattanooga</hi>, like Birmingham, is in the coal and iron district near the southern end of the Appalachian highland. Iron and steel goods are the chief manufactures in both these cities.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Knoxville</hi> is the most important trade center in the northeastern part of Tennessee.</p>
<p>During the past third of a century many wonderful changes have taken place in the Southern states. The public-school system been widely extended and many schools for higher education founded. Cotton mills have been built in scores of cities in cotton belt; iron and steel mills have rapidly increased round the southern end of the Appalachians; many lumber mills have been built to prepare the forest products for domestic and foreign trade; much larger areas have been devoted to fruits, early vegetables and other agricultural products. The railroad and steamship service has been greatly increased. Perhaps the most marked gain has been in iron and cotton manufactures.  </p>

<div type="section"><head>SOUTHERN STATES,&mdash;WESTERN SECTION</head><p> <hi rend="bold">66. Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Indian Territory,Oklahoma</hi> </p>
<p>The western section of the Southern states slopes mainly from the Rocky mountain district towards the Mississippi river and gulf of Mexico. Its climate is that of the warm part of the north temperate zone.</p>
<p>Small ranges of the Rocky mountains enter the extreme western part of Texas, but most of the northwest part of that great state is in the dry Western plains.</p>
<p>Texas contains the southern end of these plains. This part consists of a high and dry plateau, called the <hi rend="italic">Staked plain</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Llano Estacado</hi>, as the Spanish explorers named it).</p>
<p>In summer hot southwest winds often blow from over the Staked plain. They are dry and parching and do much injury to crops in their path.</p>
<p>East of the Staked plain in Texas is a broad belt of grassy land where many herds of cattle graze. East of these grazing lands are fertile prairies that yield large crops of cotton, corn and wheat. The flood plains or river bottoms of this state rank among the most fertile cotton lands in the world. Millions of sheep are found in southwest Texas.</p>
<p>East and south of the prairies lie broad coastal plains reaching to the gulf of Mexico. This portion of the state produces rice and sugar cane, chiefly in the eastern part. Eastern Texas has large forests. </p>
<p>In the region of Beaumont, in eastern Texas, have been found some of the best oil lands in the world. Natural gas also flows freely and promises to stimulate manufactures. The state has valuable coal mines, and some iron is mined. Recently large deposits of the rock called cinnabar, yielding quicksilver, have been found in southwest Texas.</p>
<p>As a whole, the coast of Texas is shallow and lined with sand bars; but there is one excellent harbor, where the city of Galveston is built on an island at the entrance to Galveston bay.</p>
<p>The state of Louisiana consists largely of coastal plain, through which the rivers have cut channels and spread out flood plains and deltas. The northern half of the state is in the coastal plain. Its soil is well suited to the growth of cotton. The rich lands along the rivers produce immense crops of sugar cane and rice. Louisiana produces more sugar cane and rice than any other state.</p>
<p>A large part of southern Louisiana is delta land made by the Mississippi. To a large extent this region is covered with river branches, swamps, lakes and bays. The delta land is so low and level that it is quickly flooded by swollen streams, and is therefore thinly settled. Moreover there are so many swamps and bodies of water that travel is very difficult. Some parts of the delta produce sugar cane and rice.</p>
<p>Below the mouth of the Ohio river the Mississippi has cut a broad valley in the coastal plain and has spread out a flood plain on the valley floor, from thirty to fifty miles wide. For about a thousand miles the Mississippi river winds through the great flood plain which is bordered on the east and west by bluffs. </p>
<p>When heavy spring rains fall and snow melts in the north, the great river overflows parts of its lowland far and wide. In times of flood the river deposits more silt near the main channel than farther away, and the surface of the flood plain therefore slopes gently <hi rend="italic">away from </hi>the river.
</p>
<p>For this reason the small rivers coming from the upland turn down the valley, near the bluffs. One of these rivers, the Yazoo, is shown on the relief map on page 70.</p>
<p>Banks of earth, called <hi rend="italic">levees</hi>, have been built for hundreds of miles along the great river, to keep the rising water from flooding the fields. In times of heavy floods the levees were formerly often broken; and as the flood plain slopes away from the river, the lowlands were quickly flooded. Thousands of acres of cotton, sugar cane and grain were then destroyed. Such accidents are now very rare. A break in the levee is called a <hi rend="italic">crevasse</hi>.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-103-a" place="in the middle of the page"><figDesc>Typical view of low mountains region extending from southwest Misswest into Arkansas</figDesc></figure>
<p>Villages on the flood plain are often built close along the river banks, where there is the least danger from floods, because the highest parts of the flood plain are near the stream.
</p>
<p>In the flood plain the Mississippi river flows in long bends or loops. Year after year the river wears away the necks of the loops, now and then cutting across one of them. Then the stream flows in its new channel, and the deserted part is left filled with standing water, forming a curved lagoon. Many lagoons on the wide flood plain show former courses of the river.
</p>
<p>For ages the Mississippi river has carried down large quantities of soil and has thus built its flood plain far out into the gulf of Mexico, making a great delta.</p>
<p>In some places jetties or walls have been built out into the river to narrow the channel and thus make the water flow more swiftly. The swift stream then deepens the channel and makes it navigable. There are large jetties at the mouth of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>The low delta plain comprises thousands of square miles. Many parts are marshes and wooded swamps. Other parts are wide stretches of grass land. Many streams cross the delta, and a large number of lakes lie in shallow hollows between them. Between the mouths of the streams are salt bays that the river has not yet filled with soil.</p>

<pb n="104" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-104" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
<p>Much of the eastern part of Arkansas is in the lowland or flood plain along the Mississippi. The soil is deep and rich, and produces much cotton. Farther from the river the state rises in broad uplands, large parts of which are covered with valuable forests, but much cotton is raised in the open lands. The western part of Arkansas has low mountain ridges, many of which are covered with forests.</p>
<p>Grass and grain thrive in most parts of the state, and many cattle and hogs are raised. Valuable pearls are taken from shellfish found in the streams of this state. Arkansas is noted for its fine apples.</p>
<p>The low mountain ridges of Arkansas extend across parts of Indian Territory and Oklahoma. Other parts of these territories are fertile prairies and produce much cotton, wheat and corn. There are also good grass lands, and many cattle and sheep are raised. The eastern part of Indian Territory is heavily forested.</p>

largest center of trade in the Southern states. Though its import trade in foreign goods is not large, yet its foreign <hi rend="italic">export</hi> trade surpasses that of every other city in the Union, except New York. New Orleans sends yearly to Europe cotton valued at nearly $100,000,000. This city has also a very large trade in sugar, rice and corn.</p>
<p>New Orleans has had rapid growth in manufactures. It takes high rank in the refining of sugar.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Shreveport</hi>, on the Red river, is in a rich cotton district. This city is the second cotton market in the state and has a large river traffic. Steamboat and railroad lines connect it with New Orleans.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Baton Rouge</hi>, a river port, is the capital.</p>
<p>TEXAS. Texas is the largest state in the Union. Its area is greater than that of all the New England and Middle states together; it is three times as large as Great Britain.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Dallas</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Fort Worth</hi> are in the northeastern part of the Texas prairies, &mdash; in a rich farming and grazing district. Both these cities handle great quantities of wheat and corn, and both have large flouring mills.</p>
<p>Dallas is a leading market for farming implements. Fort Worth has great stock yards.Many cattle are sent from this district to northern markets.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">San Antonio</hi> is an important railroad center and has a large trade in southwest Texas.
</p>
<p>San Antonio is famous in the history of Texas. Not long after the United States purchased the vast territory of Louisiana west of the Mississippi river, thousands of Americans crossed the border and settled in Texas, which was then a part of Mexico. Trouble arose between the Mexicans and the Americans; a war followed, and the Texans won the freedom of their state.
</p>
<p>One of the fiercest struggles in this war took place in a building known as the Alamo, in San Antonio. Here a small band of Americans was attacked by a large force
of Mexicans. The Americans fell fighting to the last, preferring death to surrender. Texas was soon afterwards admitted into the Union.

<div type="section"><head>CENTRAL STATES,&mdash;EASTERN SECTION</head><p> <hi rend="bold">68. Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin,Kentucky</hi></p>
<p>The eastern section of the Central states includes the part of the prairie region east of the Mississippi, and on the southeast enters the Allegheny plateau. On the north the prairies give place to the hilly region round the upper Great Lakes.</p>
<p>The eastern parts of Ohio and Kentucky are in the Allegheny plateau and have rich deposits of iron ore and coal. Ohio yields also great quantities of petroleum and natural gas. The portion of the Allegheny plateau known as the Cumberland mountains extends from Tennessee into Kentucky.</p>
<p>With the exception of the upper lake district, this group of states, including most of Ohio and the northwest half of Kentucky, consists of prairies.
</p>
<p>The level or rolling grassy prairies, the richest grain district in the world, reach to the Allegheny plateau on the east and to the dry Western plains on the west; on the south they adjoin the coastal plain that extends up the Mississippi valley to the mouth of the Ohio river; on the north they merge into the cold plains of northern Canada.
</p>
<p>When first settled by white men the prairies were the grazing ground of countless buffaloes (or bison) and deer. There many tribes of Indians had built their villages and the "braves" hunted wild animals, while their "squaws" planted corn, the native grain. Few trees grew wild in the western portion of the prairies, except along the streams. Most of the region was a sea of grass, sometimes swept by fires covering hundreds of square miles.
</p>
<p>Now all is changed. The deer have been killed or driven to the forest regions. Very few buffaloes survive, and even these are in small groups in the Western highland, where severe laws protect them from hunters. The vast grassy areas are divided into farms. Towns and cities spread over the land where the Indian villages stood. The farmhouses are surrounded by groves. In the grass lands where the red man hunted wild animals, the white man tends millions of cattle, sheep and horses. Where the savage carried to his tent the spoils of the chase, civilized man is busy with long trains of cars gathering up the wheat, the corn and the cattle, and shipping them to nearly all parts of the commercial world. In the place of the Indian runner who carried news of peace or war from one tribal village to another, long wires convey messages across the entire continent. And this marvelous change has mostly been made within the memory of men still living.
</p>
<p>The early settlers found the soil over most of the prairies deep and rich. It was. compact and hard, but after once being broken up it yielded readily to cultivation.</p>
<p>The prairie soils have been made in various ways: part as fine mud that settled on the bottoms of great lakes, since drained away; part by the decay of bed rock in the place where the soil still remains,&mdash;the slope being so gentle that the rock could decay to a

great depth before even the surface soil was washed away; part as sand and gravel left in some places by the same great ice sheet that spread from New England far west and south of the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>The prairies are in the cooler half of the north temperate zone. Westerly winds blow over them, but they cannot much moisture from the Pacific ocean, far away over the broad Western highland. The rainfall of the prairies comes chiefly in the warm winds that move up the Mississippi valley, from the gulf of Mexico. The heaviest rains fall on the parts east of the Mississippi river; but for some distance west of the river there is plenty of rain for the grain crops. Still farther west, towards the dry Western plains, the crops often suffer in periods of drouth.
</p>
<p>The summer rains of the prairies usually fall during thunderstorms. Great masses of clouds several miles high, generally moving eastward about as fast as a railroad train, give brief rains to belts of country from 50 to 200 miles wide, but leave dry regions on either side, until other storms come to water them.</p>
<p>Water sinks slowly into the compact soil of the prairies. Heavy rains therefore swell the streams. In the springtime, before the frozen soil has thawed, rains and melting snow often cause the rivers to far and wide over their flood plains.  These floods do much damage, but they also leave coatings of fine fertile soil on the plains.
</p>
<p>Wheat and corn are the principal grains raised in the prairies, but there are also large crops of rye, barley and oats. The most wheat is raised in the northern half of the prairies, and the most corn in the southern half, because wheat is hardy, while corn is easily injured or killed by frost. Oats and barley are also valuable crops. Kentucky is one of the leading states in the production of tobacco.
</p>
<p>Large quantities are raised also in other prairie states. Most of the cattle and hogs in our country are raised on the prairies, where there is plenty of grass and corn for fattening them. This is also the best sheep region.</p>
<p>Under large areas of the prairies there are beds yielding immense quantities of soft coal. This coal has been of great assistance in building up the prairie cities, as the region suffers from a scarcity of wood for fuel. Wisconsin and Illinois have rich zinc and lead mines.</p>
<p>Though the Central states have no seacoast, and therefore little foreign commerce, yet they have fine waterways for inland commerce on the Great Lakes and the Mississippi system. Moreover, most of the section is so level or so gently rolling that railroads are built at small expense.</p>
<p>One of the most important parts of this group of states is the region round the upper Great Lakes. Much of this region is heavily forested and is one of the best lumber districts in the world, though the trees have now been cut from large areas. It yields both soft woods and hard woods. The lumber has been of great value in building up the prairie towns and cities, and also in the manufacture of furniture, wagons and farming tools. The hard wood has also been used extensively in making flour barrels.
</p>
<p>The richest iron mines in the world are near the south and west shores of lance Superior. In the same vicinity and in Montana are the richest copper districts yet found.</p>
<p>The Great Lakes are in broad hollows whose lower parts, except in lake Erie, are below sea level. The surface of lake Superior is about an eighth of a mile above sea level; the other lakes are not quite so high. These lakes and the St. Lawrence river, with all the streams flowing into them, form the St. Lawrence system.
</p>
<p>Lake Superior is about twenty feet higher than lake Huron. The outlet of the upper lake is called <hi rend="italic">St. Marys river</hi>. It is about sixty miles long. This stream has rapids that are not navigable, but the "Soo" canal, which the national government has built past the rapids, allows vessels to pass from one lake to the

other. A picture on page 107 shows a vessel ready to come from the canal lock. There is another canal on the Canadian side.
</p>
<p>There are no rapids to prevent vessels from sailing freely between lakes Michigan, Huron and Erie; but between lakes Erie and Ontario there is a very steep descent in the Niagara river, at Niagara falls. What canal carries vessels between the last-named lakes?
</p>
<p>From lake Ontario the St. Lawrence river forms a waterway to the sea. The river has rapids, but canals have been built past them. Going downstream some steamers pass over the rapids.
</p>
<p>Another trade outlet from the Great Lakes is through the Erie canal. What does lesson 62 tell about this canal? There are also canals leading to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.
</p>
<p>A great drainage canal has been built from the Chicago river to the Des Plaines river, a branch of the Illinois. This canal turns
the water of the Chicago river southward towards the Mississippi and thus really form:; another outlet of lake Michigan. It is the plan to make a ship canal of this drainage canal.

</p>
<p>From what regions does Chicago receive wheat, corn, cattle, hogs, iron ore, coal, lumber? What canal route leads through Chicago?</p>
<p>Chicago has had a remarkable growth in industries as well as in population. Its nearness to the prairies and its fine position so far inland near the head of lake Michigan have made it the leading market of the world for grain and beef. As the railroads leading from the "Northwest" to eastern cities were obliged to go round the head of lake Michigan, and as the railroads from the prairies west and southwest of the city naturally ran to Chicago as the most convenient port for transferring freight to steamers on the Great Lakes, this city has grown to be the leading lake port and railroad center of the world. The iron-ore district of the upper lake region and the coal fields of Illinois find in Chicago a most economical
point for bringing the fuel and the ore together, and this city ranks second among the iron and steel centers of the country. The forests round the Great Lakes have enabled this great distributing city to become the chief lumber and furniture market on the continent.These are but a few of the great industries in which Chicago takes high rank.

<p>French missionaries and fur traders were the first white men to explore and settle most of the Central states. They came from Canada across the Great Lakes and spread far down the Mississippi valley. Among the missionaries was Marquette.

</p>
<p>Far the greater portion of this group of states consists of fertile prairies like those in the states east of the Mississippi. <hi rend="italic">Review text on prairies in lesson 68.</hi> The climate of the two parts of the prairie region is about the same, except that far westward the rain becomes less, along the border of the Western plains.
</p>
<p>The prairie states west of the great river produce immense crops of corn, wheat and other grains; the grass lands support millions of cattle, horses and, sheep; countless hogs are raised in the corn belt; rivers and railroads bear away the surplus product just as in the eastern section of the Central states.
</p>
<p>The description of the prairies given in lesson 68 applies equally to the prairie region west of the Mississippi. There are the same kinds of soil, formed in the same way in various parts; the products are similar, not only on the farms but also in mines of coal under some parts of the prairies, and in the forests that border on the northeast of the prairies in Minnesota.
</p>
<p>The richest wheat region in the world is in the valley of the Red river in Minnesota, North Dakota and the northest east corner of South Dakota. The soil is fine and deep and yields wheat of the finest quality, as well as in immense
quantities. This region also extends far northward into Canada.
</p>
<p>Ages ago a vast lake covered the valley of the Red river. Muddy streams flowed into the lake, and fine soil settled evenly over the bottom. At length the water drained away, and the smooth bottom became a level plain. This ancient lake covered the region now known as the Red river prairies, so famous for its wheat crops. The picture marked Dakota farm scene, on page 112, shows one part of these prairies.
</p>

<p>The forests of Minnesota supply both hard-wood and soft-wood trees. Nearly all the cities along the upper Mississippi have large sawmills and lumber yards. Much
of the lumber is used for buildings in the treeless parts of the prairies; also for making furniture, wagons, flour barrels and parts of farming tools.
</p>
<p>Missouri and Kansas have rich mines of. lead and zinc. The Black hills of South Dakota have very rich gold mines.
</p>
<p>The Rocky mountain streams run quickly down their sandy valleys on the Western plains and carry along large quantities of sand, making banks and bars and thus clogging the beds of the streams.
</p>
<p>One of the largest of these streams is the Missouri river. It joins the Mississippi long before the latter reaches the gulf of Mexico. From its mountain source to the gulf this is thought to be the longest river on the earth. Its name is often written Missouri-Mississippi.
</p>
<p>Large rivers like the Missouri and the Mississippi often do much damage when flooded. They sometimes cut their banks, destroying fields and washing away railroads. </p>
<p>Jetties are built in some places to protect the river banks. One of the pictures on this page shows a simple form of jetty, consisting of branches woven among stakes driven into the river bed.
</p>
<p>The jetties not only prevent swift currents from striking the banks, but they also cause the muddy water to eddy into the still water between them and there deposit mud or sand. Some river banks are protected by interwoven branches, making mattress work like that shown in one of the pictures.
</p>
<p>The western part of Kansas, Nebraska and the two Dakotas is in the Western plains and is thinly settled. The
rainfall is light and all crops are uncertain, except where.

river water is led aside to irrigate the land. Moist winds from over the gulf of Mexico seldom reach the Western plains. The westerly winds lose most of their moisture on the high mountains west of these plains; but the rain and snow falling on the Rocky mountains feed great rivers that flow eastward across the dry plains, and some of these streams are very useful in irrigating the land.
</p>
<p>Grasses grow in many parts of the Western plains, and millions of cattle are raised there. The best lands are in the river valleys or near the mountains where many small streams flow out.

<p><hi rend="bold">72. Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico</hi>
</p>
<p>The Western states may best be studied in three groups, as follows: the Rocky mountain states; the Plateau states; the Pacific coast states.</p>
<p>The high ranges of the Rocky mountains cross the states of Montana, Wyoming and Colorado, and send lower ranges southward across the territory of New Mexico. On the east side of the mountains these states extend into the dry Western plains.
</p>
<p>Review the text of lesson 70, about the Western plains.</p>
<p>A wide belt along the eastern base of the Rocky mountains in Colorado and large areas in the other states are irrigated by water led from streams coming from the mountains. This irrigated land produces fine vegetables and fruits, as well as grass and grain. Some of the products of this belt are shown in the small picture of fruits and vegetables on page 51.</p>
<p>Many cattle are raised on the plains in these states. Most of them are shipped to eastern markets.</p>
<p>The Rocky mountains are the main divide of the continent. This lofty chain contains the sources of many large rivers of our country, some flowing to the gulf of Mexico and others to the Pacific ocean or its long arm, the gulf of California. Among these are the western branches of the Mississippi; also the Rio Grande, the Colorado and branches of the Columbia.</p>
<p>The Rocky mountains consist of many parallel ranges, running mostly north and south, but bending to the north west between Montana and Idaho.</p>
<p>Between some of these ranges, especially in Colorado, are many high valleys or basins, known as parlrs. Some of these contain hundreds of square miles of land fairly level and covered with good soil washed from the surrounding mountains. Some parts are wooded, and other parts are fine pasture lands.</p>
<p>Among the best known of these are the North, Middle, South and Estes parks. The sources of the Platte, Arkansas, Colorado and Rio Grande are in this park region. These rivers, like many others of the mountain region, have cut deep canyons through the solid rock of the ranges.</p>
<p>The lofty Wasatch mountains in Utah are part of the Rocky mountain chain.

<p>In the Rocky mountains, as in all high mountains, bare crags stand out near the summits, and coarse stony waste creeps down the slopes into the valleys. The finer part of the rock waste is washed farther and is spread over the lower land. The plains along the eastern base of the Rocky mountains are made of waste which in ages past has been washed from the slopes of the great ranges.</p>
<p>In southern Wyoming the mountains drop to a high plateau,
making a break through the chain. The route of the first railroad
built across our country leads over this plateau.</p>
<p>In the northwest part of Wyoming, and extending a few miles into the border states, is Yellowstone park, an area reserved for the use of the nation and therefore called a <hi rend="italic">national park</hi>. It is famous for its geysers, hot springs, falls and canyons.</p>
<p>Some of the geysers throw streams of loot water more than two hundred feet into
the air. Steam escapes with loud roaring and makes the ground tremble. The water
in some of these fountains falls back into basins, to be belched forth again. In other geysers the water is broken into fine spray and is carried away by the wind.
</p>
<p>In many basins the water does not spout but only rises and forms pools or hot springs. These often overflow and make terraces of stone, by depositing lime or other matter.</p>
<p>The rainfall is not very heavy on the Rocky mountains in the United States, because the great chain lies far away from the sea, and much of the moisture in the westerly winds falls on high ranges near the Pacific coast. Only small parts of the Rocky mountains are forested, but even this light supply is valuable for use in the almost treeless plains along the eastern base.</p>
<p>The Rocky mountains are very rich in gold, silver, copper, lead and other metals. The copper mines at Butte, Montana, and those on the southern shores of lake Superior, are the most productive in the world. There are also valuable copper mines in Arizona.</p>
<p>Around Cripplecreek, Colorado, is one of the richest gold fields known. Both
Colorado and Montana rank very high in the production of silver. Gold and silver are found in the entire belt of states crossed by the Rocky mountains. Immense quantities of lead come from some of the ores that yield silver.</p>

<p>COLORADO. <hi rend="bold">Denver</hi> is a supply city for mining districts in the Rocky mountains and for cattle ranches on the Western plains. It is located near the foothills of the giant range of the Rockies. Few cities in our country have a more rapid growth than this state capital.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Pueblo</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Leadville</hi> have
large smelting works. The latter city is in the heart of the Rocky mountains, nearly two miles above sea level. It is one of the greatest silver-mining cities in the world and has rich gold mines. <hi rend="bold">Colorado Springs</hi> is a well-known resort for invalids.

<p><hi rend="bold">74. Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona</hi></p>
<p>The three states of Idaho, Utah and Nevada, as well as the territory of Arizona, are in the plateau region, sometimes called the basin
region. The Great Basin, between the Sierra Nevada and Wasatch mountains, is part of this plateau region.</p>
<p>The Great Basin is mainly in Utah and Nevada. Many low ranges run north and south over the basin. Little rain reaches this region, because the high Sierra lies between it and the coast from which most of the winds blow. Many of the ranges are treeless, and the plains between them are almost deserts.</p>
<p>In these plains are shallow hollows, or sinks. Winter rains flow into the sinks and form shallow lakes, but the summer drouths cause the lakes to shrink. Some of
the places covered by water in winter are parched plains in summer. In these dry plains the wind drifts the sand about like snow.What does lesson 41 tell about Great Salt lake?</p>
<p>One of the largest rivers of this basin the Humboldt. This is one of the streams that run into sinks and form salt lakes. The first railroad built across the continent follows the Humboldt river past the ends of about fifteen ranges, thus saving a hard climb over the mountains.</p>

cities and towns have grown up in this part of Utah, east and southeast of Great Salt lake. Wherever streams are used to irrigate the land, it is fertile.</p>

<p>In the western part of the Great Basin, in the Sierra Nevada, are some of the rich gold mines of the country. Several cities and towns have been built in the region of these mines. Gold and silver are found also in many other parts, of the Great Basin, and have led to the growth of many towns.</p>


<p>The northern part of Arizona is a region of high plateaus and deep canyons. The largest and deepest of the canyons is that cut in solid rock by the Colorado river and its branches.</p>


<p>These plateaus were formed ages ago by the slow uplifting of great blocks of land many miles long and wide. The tops of some of the blocks are a mile or a mile and a half above sea level. The edges of the higher blocks form cliffs a thousand or more feet high. These high blocks are known as the <hi rend="italic">Colorado plateaus</hi>.</p>

<p>Across these plateaus the Colorado river has cut its great canyon, with steep sides all rugged with cliffs and ravines. <hi rend="italic">See lesson 41</hi>.</p>


<p>Locate on the map the Grand canyon the Marble canyon. </p>


<p>This high plateau region is thinly settled, for most of the plateaus are dry and barren. But across the middle of the territory of Arizona, as well as in the southern part, some of the, ranges have forests of pine, and the towns along the railroads of the region handle lumber.</p>


<p>The southern half of Arizona is not so rugged and has more rainfall. Several cities and many towns have been built in the valley of the Gila river. Large tracts are made fertile by irrigation, and there are excellent fruit groves and grass lands. There are also rich mines yielding copper and some gold. Mining is the chief occupation.</p>


<p>The state of Idaho and the eastern half of Washington and Oregon are in the northern part of the plateau region. This section is not so high as that farther south, and it has heavier rains. There are many fertile valleys; some are covered with valuable fir and other soft-wood forests; some have deep and rich soil, which yields large crops of wheat.. Gold and silver are mined in the highlands of these states.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-118-a" place="top middle of the page"><figDesc>Flow of lava, Idaho</figDesc></figure>

<p>One of the largest lava plains in the world is in the valley of the Columbia river, east of the Cascade range. It covers parts of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and British Columbia.</p>


 
<p>Long ages ago there were large flows of lava in this region. The lava spread out over the land, till nearly 200,000 square miles of the old surface lay buried under the melted rock. This cooled in the form of a vast plain, equal to about one twentieth of the United States.</p>


<p>Ages have passed since the great flows took place. Rivers have worn canyons in the lava beds, &mdash; the largest being the can yon of the Snake river. Near the head of its canyon the river plunges over the edges of lava beds, making falls of great size and beauty. These are known as the <hi rend="italic">Shoshone falls</hi>. Along the sides of the canyon; both above and below the falls, can be seen the lava and ashes, layer on layer, through which the river has cut its deep channel.</p>


<p>When lava is worn to fine dust it forms very rich soil. Many of the river valleys of this great lava plain produce immense crops of wheat. In the less fertile parts many sheep and cattle are raised.</p>

<p>The three coast states, California, Oregon and Washington, are crossed by the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountains, which form the western border of the plateau region. West of these ranges are several long fertile valleys, partly inclosed by low Coast ranges on the west.</p>

<p>The high Sierra Nevada and the Cascades receive plentiful rains from the westerly winds. Their western slopes in California, Oregon and Washington are forested with fir and other trees yielding valuable lumber. <hi rend="italic">See lesson 48</hi>. </p>

<p>The Yosemite valley is on the Pacific slope of the Sierra Nevada. <hi rend="italic">See map on page 117</hi>. The depth of this wonderful valley is so great, and its sides are so steep, that hundreds of people visit it every year.</p>

<p>In some places its sides are about half a mile in height. Beautiful streams from the upland leap over cliffs into the valley.</p>

<p>The Sierra Nevada is one of the richest goldbearing ranges in the Union. We have already seen that mining cities and towns have been built in western Nevada, where this range touches that state. There are also many mining cities along the west slope of the high range in California.</p>


<p>Gold was discovered in California in 1848, at just about the time when the treaty of peace was signed with Mexico. which made California a part of the United States. During the next year the "gold craze" spread over the country, and the rush for the gold fields began.</p>


<p>The first gold was found in grovels in a channel, or mill race, that was being dug to carry water for a sawmill. For a long time most of the gold was taken from river grovels; then cliffs were found formed of gold-bearing grovels buried under beds of lava. Many of these cliffs were torn Z down by sending strong streams of water against them, as shown in a picture on page 58. This is called <hi rend="italic">hydraulic mining</hi>. Later, veins of quartz rock were found to contain much gold, and deep mines were dug to reach these veins in the mountains. </p>

<p>Some gold is found in the Cascade mountains of Oregon and Washington, but not so much as in the Sierra Nevada.</p>

<p>The valley of California, west of the Sierra Nevada, is famous for its wheat crops. Another rich wheat section is found in the valley of the Willamette river, flowing into the Columbia. We have already learned that some of the river valleys of the lava plain east of the Cascade mountains produce wheat. The Pacific coast states export much wheat and flour.</p>


<p>These states are also noted for their fruits. Oregon and Washington cherries are found in the markets of nearly all large cities of the United States; the valley of California is the best grape and raisin section of the country; apricots and prunes thrive in many small valleys between low ridges of the Coast range in California; oranges and lemons of the finest quality in the world are raised in many part's of southern California.</p>


<p>The western coast of the United States has few good harbors. The best is at San Francisco. Pnget sound forms a large and safe harbor for several cities. The harbor of Portland is on the Willamette river, not far from where that stream joins the Columbia.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-119-b" place="lower middle of the page"><figDesc>Yosemite valley, California</figDesc></figure>

<p>CALIFORNIA. <hi rend="bold">San Francisco</hi> is the natural outlet for the products of the valley of California. More wheat is exported from this seaport than from any other American city. It leads also in the refining of sugar, which it receives from the Hawaiian islands.</p>


<p>San Francisco has a large inland trade in wheat, flour fruits. The principal manufactures of the city are clothing, boots and shoes.</p>


<p>Among the imports are silk and tea from China and Japan, and brown sugar from Honolulu. On an arm of San Francisco bay, a few miles northward from the Golden Gate, there is a large navy yard.</p>


<p><hi rend="bold">Los Angeles </hi>is the largest trade center in southern California. This city is an active fruit market. It is also the center of a rich oil district.</p>

<p>OREGON. The portion of this state east of the Cascade range has large cattle ranches. The Willamette valley is an excellent wheat district. Many sheep are also raised here. The Cascade and Coast ranges are heavily forested, and they yield valuable lumber products. The salmon fisheries in the Columbia river are the most important in the world. <hi rend="bold">Portland</hi>, on the Willamette branch of the Columbia river, is the commercial center of the state. <hi rend="bold">Salem</hi>, the capital, is in the wheat and the wool district of the Willamette valley.</p>

</p>

<p>The entire territory of Alaska is a vast peninsula, partly bounded by two oceans and a large sea. In the southwest part is a small arm of land, known as the <hi rend="italic">peninsula of Alaska</hi>, extending out to the chain of Aleutian islands, partly inclosing Bering sea.</p>

<p>Several scores of small islands form the Aleutian chain stretching along the south border of Bering sea. The islands are mostly of volcanic origin, and some of the craters are now active. The people resemble the Eskimos. The climate of the islands is severe and the soil is poor. The people therefore live by hunting and fishing.</p>


<p>Alaska is twice as large as Texas and almost one sixth as large as the United States proper. Along the Pacific coast rise the Alaskan mountains, the highest on the continent.</p>

<p>The crowning peak, as far as is yet known, is Mt. McKinley, nearly four miles high. Just across the border in Canada are two other noted peaks, Mt. Logan and Mt. St. Elias, in the same great range.</p>


<p>The larger part of Alaska is a plateau region, but there are low tundras or frozen marshy plains along the Arctic coast and in the large river valleys. The Yukon is the principal river; its basin is perhaps about one third as large as the Mississippi basin.</p>


<p>The Yukon is building an immense delta. This stream is navigable by river steamers for about 1500 miles above the delta and is useful in carrying supplies to mining camps. The Yukon is frozen about eight months each year.</p>


<p>Alaska has one of the many coasts that are very irregular because the land has partly settled beneath the sea, letting the water flow far into valleys and thus forming bays, peninsulas and islands. One great chain of islands, the <hi rend="italic">Aleutians</hi>, stretches along the southern side of Bering sea; another .chain extends along the west coast of Canada, as far as Puget sound.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-122-a" place="middle ot the page"><figDesc>Sitka, Alaska</figDesc></figure>

<p>A long ocean current flows across the Pacific, in the torrid zone, sending one branch northward along the east coast of Asia. Passing the Japan islands, this current takes the name of <hi rend="italic">Japan current</hi> and continues far northeast to the southern shore of Alaska, becoming somewhat cooler as it flows. Thence part bends southward along the western coast of North America.</p>

<p>The summer winds that blow from over the Japano current towards the southern shore of Alaska are mild and moist. They give heavy rainfall to the coast region and the southern slopes of the Alaskan range, and heavy snowfall to the upper parts of the mountains. In winter, when the air is much colder, snow falls both in the mountains and along the coast. The lower southern or seaward slope has large forests.</p>


<p>The upper slopes of the mountains are always covered with snow, and down the valleys on their sides flow great glaciers. Some of these rivers of ice enter the sea and break off in huge icebergs.</p>


<p>The portion of Alaska north of the mountain chain does not receive the mild moist winds and is therefore colder and drier than the southern coast region; but there is rainfall enough for open forests in parts of the interior. There the winter climate is very severe and the nights of that season are very long; but the air of summer is clear, cool and bracing, and there are many hours of daylight.</p>


<p>Some hardy vegetables and hay can be raised in the milder southern coastal region, but the air is too damp, and the summer season too short, for grains to ripen.</p>

<p>Gold has been found in various parts of Alaska, &mdash; near the town of Juneau; in the cape Nome district north of the Yukon delta; and near the region where the Yukon river crosses from Canada to Alaska. The latter is near the famous Klondike gold region of Canada.</p>


<p>Only a small part of Alaska, along the southern coast, is really suitable for the homes of white people. There they have built <hi rend="bold">Sitka</hi>, the capital of the territory; <hi rend="bold">Juneau</hi>, near the southeast coast; <hi rend="bold">Nome</hi>, a rich mining town north of the Yukon delta. The gold fields have led thousands of men to seek their fortunes in the colder parts of Alaska and there to build small towns.</p>

<p>Among the large land animals are the caribou, the reindeer and the polar bear; but there are also many small fur-bearing animals. The shore waters abound in cod, and great quantities of salmon are taken in the rivers. Bering sea is the best sealing region in the world. Fishing and fur trading are important industries.</p>


<p>The best sealing grounds are on the Pribilof islands, far out in Bering sea. In summer countless seals go there to feed and to rear their young. Many are then killed for their fine fur. These islands belong to the United States. The Commander islands, another noted group of sealing islands in the same sea but nearer the coast of Asia, belong to Russia.</p>


<p>About a third of a century ago (1867) the United States bought Alaska from Russia, paying for it $7,200,000. This is a small sum compared with the value of the furs, fish, lumber and gold which this region produces.</p>


<p>The original settlers in Alaska were Eskimos and Indians. The first white settlers were Russian fur traders. After the purchase by the United States small numbers of Americans went to Alaska to engage in the fur trade and fisheries. Later large numbers went to the gold fields; but along the coast there are still more Eskimos and Indians than white people.</p>

</p>

<p>Far out in the Pacific, about 2000 miles from San Francisco and in about the same latitude as Porto Rico, lie the islands of the Hawaiian group. They have a tropical climate, with plentiful rainfall. There are eight <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-123-a" place="top half of page"></figure> principal islands and a number of rocky islets. The total area is about one third greater than that of Connecticut.
</p>
<p>These islands extend northwest and southeast for about 400 miles. They are of volcanic origin and are built up from the bottom of the ocean, which is here about 16,000 to 18,000 feet deep.
</p>
<p>The largest island is Hawaii, and the same name is often given to the entire group. Most parts of the islands are rugged with cones, ridges and other forms of lava flows, but there are also many valleys of great fertility. The rich soil is well watered, and the vegetation is luxuriant. Tropical fruits abound; but sugar, rice and coffee are the chief products and leading exports.

<p>On the island of Hawaii rise two of the highest peaks in all the Pacific isles,&mdash;the volcanoes of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-123-b" place="bottom of page"></figure>Although their summits are only a little more than two and a half miles above sea level, yet the peaks really rise from the sea-bottom, a distance of over six miles.
</p>
<p>Mauna Loa is active; on its east slope is the huge active crater of Kilauea, world-famed for its size and for the grandeur of its seething lake of molten lava. There are other active craters in the island, and earthquakes are frequent. Several violent eruptions have taken place in recent years, both on the land and in the border bays. Thousands of persons every year visit Hawaii to study the volcanoes and hot springs, as well as to observe the people and enjoy the mild climate.
</p>
<p>The native people of the Hawaiian islands are happy and lighthearted. They  belong to the brown race and are more intelligent than any other natives of the Pacific islands, except some of the Filipinos. There are about 38,000 of these aborigines in the Hawaiian islands. The number of Japanese settlers in these islands is much greater, and the number of Chinese a few thousand less. There are also several thousand Americans, as well as white people of other nations.
</p>
<p>Various chiefs, kings and queens ruled Hawaii until July 4, 1894, when the white people there formed a republic. About four years later the islands were annexed to the United States.
</p>
<p>Hawaii is one of the territories of the United States. What are the names of the others? <hi rend="italic">See page 70</hi>. Locate this territory on the commercial map on page 190.
</p>
<p>The island of Molokai contains a leper settlement. Leprosy is the worst scourge among the natives, and the victims are sent to this island to prevent the spread of the disease.

<p><hi rend="bold">Honolulu</hi> is the capital and chief city of the islands. It is finely located on a deep harbor on the south side

of the island of Oahu. The largest ocean steamers can lie along its great wharves, to load or unload.</p>

<p>In recent years Honolulu has made rapid progress. It has good schools, tramways, electric lights, telephones, beautiful public buildings and homes. Owing to its mild even climate, this city is a favorite resort for tourists. It has regular steamship connections with San Francisco and the Asiatic countries along the Pacific.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">80. Philippine Islands</hi></p>

<p>The great group of tropical islands known as the <hi rend="italic">Philippines </hi>came under the control of the United States at the close of the war with Spain. This group of islands is southeast of Asia and partly incloses the China sea. There are eleven principal islands and many small ones. The largest is Luzon, with an area about equal to that of New York state; next in size is the southern island of Mindanao, nearly as large. The total area of the Philippine islands is about equal to that of all New England and New York state.</p>


<p>These islands were discovered by Magellan during the famous first voyage round the world. Magellan was killed here, and only one of his ships reached home.</p>


<p>These islands, like the Hawaiian group, are largely made of volcanic rock and contain active craters, as well as hot springs, old and new lava flows, huge crevices or fissures and other proofs of former volcanic activity.</p>

<p>The mountain ranges have in general a northerly trend, bending to the northwest in some of the islands. The highest peaks rise only a little more than a mile and a half above the sea. Though most parts of the islands are hilly or mountainous, there are river valleys, slopes and plains of wonderful fertility. Here, as in most tropical lands, the rainy season comes in summer, or from flay to October, with some rains during the other months. Lakes, rivers and smaller streams abound and combine with mountains and forests to give great beauty to the scenery.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-124-c" place="upper right of the page"><figDesc>Shrimp fisher</figDesc></figure> 

<p>The climate of the Philippines is that of the torrid zone; but with the great length of the archipelago north and south comes variety in heat and rainfall. The large island of Luzon and its smaller border isles have bright skies, with cool and dry air, during the winter months. Even in summer the sea breezes and many cool nights bring relief.</p>


<p>With plentiful rainfall and heat these islands have luxuriant vegetation. Hills and plains alike are buried in foliage. There are immense forests yielding dyes, gums and cabinet woods. The cocoanut palm and bamboo thrive throughout the islands and are put to a large number of uses.</p>


<p>Sugar is a leading product, but the staple products for which the islands have long been noted are fine tobacco and Manila hemp, the latter being the fiber of a kind of plantain or banana plant, and not true hemp. It is used for making rope and twine. The plant is hardy and grows best in the fine lava soils of the hilly regions.</p>


<p>Strips of the banana or hemp-producing plant are drawn across long knife blades to remove the outer skin and pulp, thus leaving the fiber; this is cleansed by washing, dried in the sun and packed in bundles. It is then ready to send to the coast for shipment.</p>

<p>Large crops of rice are raised in the Philippines and used there for food, Bananas o are also a staple food product. Oranges, pineapples and other tropical fruits grow in abundance.</p>


<p>Although the neighboring island of Borneo has large wild animals, such as the elephant, tapir and orang-outang, these are not found in the Philippines. The only beasts of prey are small wildcats. There are wild buffaloes and wild hogs in the islands, but these are thought to have descended from tame animals that escaped to the woods.</p>


<p>The most useful animal is the carabao, or buffalo, &mdash; known also as the <hi rend="italic">water buffalo</hi>, from its habit of rolling in water. It is used to draw the rude plows and carts, as well as to carry burdens on its back. Sheep and goats are reared; monkeys, huge bats, birds, snakes and insects abound in many parts of the archipelago.</p>


<p>Careful study of the mineral resources has not yet been made, but it is known that gold, iron, copper, zinc, sulphur
 


<pb n="125" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-125" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />

and coal promise a rich reward to future miners in the islands.</p>

<p>The primitive people of the Philippines are thought to be the <hi rend="italic">Negritos</hi>, a dwarfish black race now found in the mountains of Luzon and Negros islands. They have the frizzly black hair, thick lips and wide nostrils, such as are seen among other people of the black race. The Negritos were long ago hunted from the lowlands by stronger people of the brown or Malay race, and now wander over the, ranges and through the forests, without fixed homes, eating wild fruits and sleeping wherever they may be when darkness comes on.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-125-a" place="upper left of the page"><figDesc>Family of Negritos</figDesc></figure>

<p>Of the eight or nine million natives of this great archipelago, nearly all belong to the Malay race. In some parts of the islands they are called <hi rend="italic">Filipinos</hi>. The Malays of the cities and towns are bright and intelligent, but the people of the forest and mountain tribes are "simple children of nature." The people on many of the islands are little known, but some of them are fierce and warlike.</p>


<p>Many of the tribes of the interior live on wild fruits, fish and game, with little thought of tilling the soil. The lance, bow and arrows are native weapons. During the dry season entire tribes wander through the forests, sleeping without other shelter than the trees; others make rude huts of bamboo, palm or rattan. On the various islands the natives differ in intelligence, beliefs, habits and modes of living.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-125-b" place="bottom middle of the page"><figDesc>Hemp press, Manila</figDesc></figure>	

<p>Many Chinese have settled in the larger towns and cities. They are thrifty and carry on most of the local trade and banking. A few thousand Spanish and other people of the white race live in Manila, Iloilo and other towns. Nearly all the large towns are on the seacoast. Hundreds of American teachers and thousands of American soldiers are now serving in the Philippines.</p>


<p><hi rend="bold">Manila </hi>is the capital and largest city of the archipelago. It is about as large as San Francisco and is situated on a fine bay at the mouth of the Pasig river, the outlet of Bai lake. The greater part of the foreign trade of the islands passes through Manila.</p>


<p>The harbor of Manila is not deep enough for the largest steamships to lie along the wharves to load and unload. The freight for such steamers is loaded and unloaded on boats. But vessels drawing less than sixteen feet of water can reach the wharves.</p>

<p>The older part of the city is on the south bank of the Pasig river; the newer part is on the north bank. The modern buildings are mostly low and built of wood, as they withstand earthquake shocks better than high stone structures.</p>


<p>During the late war with Spain American warships destroyed a Spanish fleet in the harbor of Manila.</p>


<p><hi rend="bold">Iloilo </hi>is the second port of importance. It is on the island of Panay.</p>


<p>The exports of the islands are mostly hemp, tobacco and sugar. The principal imports are rice, flour, cloth, coal and kerosene. The foreign trade is chiefly with Great Britain and the United States.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">81. Other Island Possessions in the Pacific</hi></p>


<p>GUAM. Almost due east of Manila, about 1600 miles out in the Pacific, lies the island of Guam, which Spain ceded to the United States at the close of the late war. It is the southernmost of a chain of islands stretching northward for about 500 miles. Magellan named these the <hi rend="italic">Ladrones</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">thieves' islands</hi>, because the natives stole some of his goods. <hi rend="italic">For Guam and other islands named below, see inset on map of Philippines, page 127; also map on page 187</hi>.</p>


<p>The Ladrone islands are small and mostly volcanic in origin, and some have active craters. The climate is mild, like that of Hawaii. The total area is only 175 square miles, with a population of about 9000: Guam, the island belonging to our country, is the most important island of the group, and most of the natives live there. Fully half of the people are in the capital town of Aga&ntilde;a.</p>


<p>The island of Guam is the largest of the Ladrones, being about 100 miles in circuit and 30 miles in length. It has a fringing coral reef.</p>





 

<pb n="126" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-126" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />

<p>When first visited by Magellan there were thought to be about 50,000 natives in this group of islands, but under the rule of white men the original natives became extinct. The present natives are descendants of Philippine tribes. They have several schools, and most of the inhabitants can read and write. Spanish is the common language. A few white people live in Agana.</p>


<p>Guam has no foreign trade, as it does not lie in the path of ocean steamers. The island will be made a coaling station and base of supplies for ships of the American navy.</p>


<p>TUTUILA AND MANUA ISLANDS. These islands are about as far south of the equator as Manila is north of that line, but they are far out in the Pacific, east of Australia. <hi rend="italic">See map of Australia, page 187</hi>. They belong to a group known as the <hi rend="italic">Samoa islands</hi>.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-126-a" place="upper middle of the page"><figDesc>Military road between San Juan and Ponce</figDesc></figure>

<p>The Samoans are very skillful in using canoes, and for this reason their islands are often called the Navigator's islands. The two largest islands of the group belong to Germany; their chief town is <hi rend="bold">Apia</hi>.</p>


<p>Tutuila and the Manna group belong to the United States. Their best harbor is <hi rend="bold">Pago Pago</hi>, on Tutuila. It will be used as a coaling station. Tutuila is rugged with mountains, but there are dense forests and fertile valleys. The people belong to the brown race.</p>


<p>WAKE ISLAND. About as far northeast of Guam as this island is east of Manila, the little island known as Wake island has been built by coral polyps in the Pacific. It has many trees, but it is a lonely spot far out in the ocean and nobody lives on it. This is one of many tiny islands owned by the United States.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">82. Porto Rico and Virgin Islands
</hi></p>

<p>Porto Rico has, in general, the shape of a rectangle. It is about 100 miles in length by 36 in breadth, and is about three fourths as large as Connecticut.</p>


<p>The island has no large mountains, its loftiest peaks being only three fourths of a mile in height. For the most part the inland regions are hilly, with wooded ridges running east and west, sending small rivers to the seacoast on all sides. A broad belt of coastal region consists of level tracts, or <hi rend="italic">savannas</hi>, alternating with uneven ridgy areas.</p>


<p>This island is in the torrid zone and has the wet and the dry seasons of that zone. Its lowlands have hot or warm weather almost all the year, with cool weather during the northern midwinter. Here, as in the rest of the torrid zone, the rainy season is during the hottest months. Day breezes from the sea and cool nights help to temper the hot climate and make it healthful. Porto Rico is one of the most healthful islands of the West Indies. Its hilly regions are cooler than the lowlands and afford relief from the intense summer heat.</p>


<p>The river valleys, coastal plains and hillsides of Porto Rico are very fertile. By far the most valuable product is coffee, which thrives on the gentle slopes of the hillsides. Next in value is sugar. Molasses and tobacco, with the coffee and sugar, are the leading exports.</p>


<p>What does lesson 31 tell about sugar? About coffee? What does lesson 32 tell about tobacco?</p>


<p>About one million people live in Porto Rico. Of these, two thirds are white and one third are Negroes. Nearly all the white people are of Spanish descent.</p>


<p>Before the recent war between the United States and Spain this island belonged to Spain. At the close of the war Porto Rico was ceded to the United States.</p>


<p>The cities and towns are mostly near the coast. <hi rend="bold">San Juan</hi> is the chief city of the north coast and the capital of the island. It is built on a fine harbor.</p>


<p><hi rend="bold">Ponce</hi>, the largest city near the south coast, is connected with the capital by a military road running across the island. Other important cities share with the two named the export trade in coffee, sugar, molasses and tobacco. The chief articles of import are cloth and metal wares. Most of the trade is with the United States.</p>


<p>VIRGIN ISLANDS. East of Porto Rico lies a group of small islands known as the <hi rend="italic">Virgin islands</hi>. Of these, Vieques, Culebra and a few smaller rocky islands belong to the United States. <hi rend="italic">See map on page 135</hi>. The Senate of this country has also approved a treaty for the purchase of St. Thomas, St. Croix (or Santa Cruz) and St. Johns from Denmark. Still farther east are several small islands of this group, belonging to Great Britain.</p>


<p>The Virgin islands are mountainous, but there are fertile areas. Sugar is the principal product. St. Croix has an area of eighty-three square miles; St. Thomas is a little over one third as large; St. Johns is smaller. The chief port is <hi rend="bold">Charlotte Amalie</hi>, on the latter island. It has a deep harbor, where ships can outride with safety all storms except hurricanes from the south.</p>

<div type="section"><head>FORM OF GOVERNMENT</head><p><hi rend="bold">83. Form of Government </hi></p>

<p>The United States has grown to be the foremost republic and the wealthiest nation in the world.</p>


<p>The highest law of the nation is known as the <hi rend="italic">Constitution of the United States</hi>. This written law, or body of laws, was adopted in Philadelphia<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-128-1" n="1"></note> by men chosen from the thirteen states a few years after the Revolutionary war. It has since received several additions, or <hi rend="italic">amendments</hi>.</p>


<p>The Constitution states what the form of our government shall be; names the various offices; indicates how the offices are to be filled; defines the authority of the officers; limits the power of the lawmakers; provides for national or <hi rend="italic">Federal</hi> courts, of which the highest is the <hi rend="italic">Supreme Court</hi>; and, in general, forms the highest law of the land.</p>

<p>The government has three main branches: one makes the laws; a second explains or interprets the laws; a third enforces the laws. The first is the <hi rend="italic">legislative</hi> branch; the second, the <hi rend="italic">judicial</hi>; the third, the <hi rend="italic">executive</hi>.</p>


<p>The law-making or <hi rend="italic">legislative</hi> department of the United States is known as <hi rend="italic">Congress</hi>. It consists of two bodies, &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">Senate</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">House of Representatives</hi>.</p>


<p>The representatives are chosen by the people. The senators are chosen by the law-making bodies, or <hi rend="italic">legislatures</hi>, in the various states. There are two senators from each state. The representatives are chosen according to the number of people in the state, but each state has at least one representative. Senators are elected to serve for six years; representatives, for two years.</p>

<p>The chief executive officer is called the <hi rend="italic">President</hi>. He is elected to serve for four years, and his duty is to enforce or execute the laws. He is Commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States.</p>


<p>To aid in conducting the government, the President (with the approval of the Senate) appoints eight men who are known as members of the <hi rend="italic">Cabinet</hi>. These officers superintend the foreign affairs, the finances, the army, the navy, the home affairs, the law cases, the postal matters and the agricultural interests of the nation.</p>


<p>With the President is elected a <hi rend="italic">Vice-President</hi>, who presides over the Senate and who succeeds to the office of President if it becomes vacant during his term.</p>


<p>The President and Vice-President are chosen by <hi rend="italic">electors</hi>, who are elected by the people. If the electors fail to elect, the national House of Representatives elects a President, and the Senate elects a Vice-President.</p>


<p>A proposed law presented to Congress for action is called a <hi rend="italic">bill</hi>. It becomes a national <hi rend="italic">law</hi> when it receives the consent of a majority of each body of lawmakers and the approval of the President. If the President disapproves or <hi rend="italic">vetoes</hi> a bill, it cannot become a law without receiving a two thirds vote of each body, &mdash; Senate and House of Representatives.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Supreme Court</hi> of the United States consists of a <hi rend="italic">chief Justice</hi> and eight <hi rend="italic">Associate Justices</hi> appointed by the President, with the consent of the Senate, and holding office for life or during good behavior. There are also lower or inferior courts belonging to the general government. Together they are called the <hi rend="italic">Federal courts</hi>.</p>


<p>The Federal courts may be called upon to decide such questions as these: cases arising between parties of different states; cases that depend on the meaning of treaties between this country and any other; cases that depend on the right of Congress to make certain laws; cases arising from trouble on American ships at sea; cases that affect consuls (<hi rend="italic">see lesson 39</hi>) and some other public officers serving in foreign lands. Some of these cases are tried first by an inferior court, with right of appeal to the Supreme Court; but others are taken at once before the highest court.</p>


<p>All rights that the states did not give to the Union, under the Constitution, they reserved for themselves. From time to time new states have been added to the original thirteen, till now there are forty-five, &mdash;about three and a half times as many as in 1776. Each state resembles a republic and has ifs Constitution, its Senate and House of Representatives, its Supreme Court, and its chief executive officer, called a <hi rend="italic">governor</hi>, &mdash; as well as other officers.</p>


<p>Some parts of our country are not included in any state, but are known as <hi rend="italic">territories</hi>. Their governors and judges are appointed by the President, with the consent of the Senate. The territories elect their own legislative bodies.</p>


<p>We have seen that there are now six territories, namely, Alaska, in the far northwest part of the continent; Hawaii, a group of islands far out in the Pacific; Arizona and New Mexico, bordering on Mexico and having no seacoast; Oklahoma and Indian Territory, not far from the center of the United States. The other divisions of the country, except the District of Columbia (<hi rend="italic">see below</hi>) and the detached island possessions, are states.</p>


<p>Indian Territory differs from the other territories in not having a governor appointed by the President. This territory has been set apart as a home for certain tribes of Indians.</p>


<p>Congress has not yet decided as to the final form of government for Porto Rico and the Philippines.</p>


<p>From time to time, as the territories increase in population, some of them are admitted into the Union as states.</p>


<p>Congress meets in the city of Washington, the Supreme Court sits there, the President resides in that city, and the members of the Cabinet have their offices there. Washington is therefore the <hi rend="italic">capital</hi> of the United States.</p>


<p>The city of Washington, with its suburb Georgetown, is on a tract of land ceded by the state of Maryland for the use of the government. This tract of land is known as the <hi rend="italic">District of Columbia</hi>. It is neither a state nor a territory, but is under the control of Congress.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">84. Canada, Newfoundland and Northern Islands</hi></p>

<p>The surface of Canada is similar in many respects to that of the United States. In the west rise the lofty ranges of the Rocky mountain highland; in the east is the lower highland, chiefly in the Labrador peninsula; between them spreads the Central plain.</p>

<p>The Western, highland of Canada consists of many ranges; the most important are the Coast range and the Rocky mountains. The former is a continuation of the Cascade mountains.</p>

<p>Both of these ranges are in the path of the westerly winds and receive plentiful rainfall. The summits are heavily snow clad and large glaciers are found on their slopes. The mountains, as well as the lower parts of the highland, are densely wooded.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-129-a" place="middle of the page"></figure>

<p>Among the loftiest peaks of this highland are Mt. Logan and Mt. St. Elias, near the border of Alaska; but neither of these peaks is so high as Mt. McKinley in Alaska.</p>

<p>Branches of the Yukon river drain part of the northern region of the Rocky mountain highland. The famous Klondike gold district is in the Yukon basin, not far from the place where the river flows into Alaska. <hi rend="bold">Dawson </hi>is one of several towns that have sprung up in this gold-bearing district. <hi rend="italic">See map on page 72</hi>.</p>

<p>The St. Lawrence river flows in a valley that separates two parts of the eastern highland of North America. In the great peninsula of Labrador, between the gulf of St. Lawrence and Hudson bay, the highland consists of a low but rugged plateau, above which rise bare rocky hills; but no part forms a true mountain range.</p>

<p>In the valleys of this low plateau are many lakes and swamps through which streams flow. These lakes were formed in the same manner as those in New England. <hi rend="italic">See lesson 60</hi>. Forests cover a large part of the region.</p>

<p>The winter winds which reach the peninsula of Labrador often blow from the north and are then cold and piercing. The winds that blow from the sea are also chilly, for a cold polar current sweeps past this part of the Atlantic coast.</p>
 
<p>Fur-bearing animals, as well as deer and wild fowl, are numerous, and the few thousand Indians and still fewer white people who make their homes in that cold region live by hunting. In summer they travel in canoes through lakes and streams, thus avoiding the swamps and forests.</p>

<p>The region west of Hudson bay and extending down the Mackenzie river basin to the Arctic coast is mostly a lowland, having many swamps, lakes and rivers. These lakes also were mostly formed in the same manner as those in New England.</p>

<p>For a long distance inland from the Arctic coast the plain is frozen all the year, except when the summer sun thaws a few inches of the topsoil. The southern part of the Mackenzie basin has forests and open grass lands. Large herds of reindeer, called <hi rend="italic">caribou</hi>, are found in this district and even farther north.</p>

<p>Small tribes of Indians live on the bleak plains, and bands of Eskimos are found along the shores of the Arctic ocean and Hudson bay. To these people
the caribou (<hi rend="italic">see page 52</hi>) are of great value. The flesh is one of the staple foods, and the skins are used in making clothing and tents.</p>

<p>The most productive part of Canada consists of a broad belt of land about four hundred miles wide, lying along the northern border of the United States and reaching from ocean to ocean. This includes the region round the gulf of St. Lawrence, the valley of the St. Lawrence river, the section round the Great Lakes, the fertile prairies in the valleys of the streams flowing to lake Winnipeg, and the Pacific coast region.</p>

<p>Canada, or the <hi rend="italic">Dominion of Canada</hi>, comprises various provinces and districts. Nova Scotia, Prince Edward island, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia are <hi rend="italic">provinces</hi>; the other divisions, formed of parts of the thinly settled regions once known as territories, are called <hi rend="italic">districts</hi>.</p>

 

<pb n="130" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-130" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />

<p>The island of Newfoundland and a small part of the adjacent mainland do not form a part of Canada; but both Newfoundland and Canada belong to the British empire.</p>

<p>Canada and Newfoundland are parts of a limited monarchy. The governor-general of each is appointed by the king of Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p>The law-making or <hi rend="italic">legislative</hi> department of Canada consists of a Senate and a House of Commons. The members of the former are appointed for life; the members of the latter are elected by the people, as in our own country.</p>


<p>Canada is about equal in area to the United States, but has only about one twelfth as many people. A large part of Canada once belonged to France, and many people of French descent still live there, though they are now greatly outnumbered by the English-speaking population.</p>


<p>In surface, climate and products the provinces of Canada along the northern border of the United States resemble the portions of our country which they adjoin.</p>

<p>The most thickly settled portion of Canada is the region extending eastward from lake Huron, down the St. Lawrence valley to the gulf. It includes parts of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Barley and wheat thrive here, soft-wood forests abound, and large numbers of sheep and cattle find excellent pasturage.</p>

<p>In this productive area are found most of the large cities of Canada. Among these are <hi rend="bold">Montreal, Toronto, Quebec, Hamilton</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Ottawa </hi>; the latter is the capital. These cities have a large trade in lumber, barley, sheep and wool, cattle and hides.</p>

<p>The city of Montreal owes its growth largely to the fact that it is below the lowest rapids of the St. Lawrence river. Ocean steamers can ascend the river as far as this city.</p>

<p>The Red river prairies extend northward into Canada. These and other fertile prairie lands in the valleys of the streams flowing to lake Winnipeg yield immense quantities of wheat. The city of <hi rend="bold">Winnipeg </hi>in the province of Manitoba is the most important center of trade for this famous wheat district.</p>

<p>British Columbia, like the state of Washington, has valuable coal mines, forests and fisheries. The chief cities of the province are <hi rend="bold">Vancouver</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Victoria</hi>. The latter is on Vancouver island.</p>


<p>Newfoundland and the provinces of Canada round the gulf of St. Lawrence have extensive fisheries. <hi rend="bold">Halifax </hi>and <hi rend="bold">St. Johns </hi>send large quantities of codfish to the United States. Most of these are caught on the Grand Bank, southeast of Newfoundland.</p>


<p>New Brunswick, like Maine, is in the soft-wood forest belt. The city of <hi rend="bold">St. John</hi> exports lumber.</p>


<p>Far to the northeast of North America are the two large islands of Greenland and Iceland. The Arctic circle crosses the former and runs through a small peninsula of the latter. All Iceland and the southern part of Greenland belong to Denmark, a small country in Europe.</p>


<p>The interior of Greenland is buried under a sheet of ice and snow thousands of feet thick. Wide and deep glaciers from this ice sheet creep slowly into the sea, where huge blocks break off, forming icebergs. It is thought that the vast ice sheet that once spread over Canada, New England and the states round the Great Lakes (<hi rend="italic">see lesson 60</hi>) was similar to that of Greenland to-day, only much larger.</p>


<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-132-a" place="middle of the page"></figure>

<p>A small current drifts northward from the Gulf stream to the southwest shore of Greenland and helps to make the climate milder there than over the rest of the great island. Eskimos and white people, the latter mostly Danes or people of Denmark, have built villages along the southwest coast.</p>


<p>Iceland is a volcanic island. Its inland region has large lava flows and is cold and barren. A few thousand people, mostly Danes, have settled round the coast. They raise a few vegetables and have flocks of sheep. Eider ducks build their nests on this island as well as on Greenland, and the fine feathers, or <hi rend="italic">eider down</hi>, with which they line their nests are of great value. Codfish and other food fish are caught in the waters around Iceland.</p>


<p>This island is remarkable for its volcanoes and geysers; one of the latter throws a column of water about 150 feet into the air. Mt. Hekla is the best known of the volcanoes of Iceland.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole of Mexico is a plateau region forming part of the Western highland of North America. The narrow southern end of the plateau of Mexico is about a mile and a half above sea level. A chain of lofty volcanoes extends east and west across this end of the highland.</p>


<p>Orizaba is the highest of these peaks, though not nearly so high as Mt. McKinley. Popocatepetl is another high peak in this volcanic region. Indians that live on the sides of this volcano take sulphur in large quantities from the crater.</p>


<p>The highest range of mountains running northward in Mexico is the Sierra Madre, in the western part of the plateau.</p>


<p>The plateau of Mexico and the narrow coastal plains along the shore of the gulf of Mexico receive summer rainfall from the trade winds. This coastal region is hot and unhealthful; it consists largely of swampy lands, densely wooded. The western slopes of the highlands of Mexico are dry.</p>


<p>Part of Mexico is in the torrid zone and part is in the warm belt farther north; but because of height and nearness to the equator, the climate of the plateau of Mexico is mild and there are no long periods of great heat or cold. Millions of white people and Indians live in Mexico, chiefly in the plateau region where there is good farming and grazing land. Cattle raising is here a leading industry. Among the agricultural products are coffee, cotton, sugar cane and tobacco.</p>


<p>In some parts of Mexico, especially in Yucatan, is raised a variety of century plant that yields a kind of fiber known as sisal hemp. This hemp is shipped in large quantities to our country, where it is used in making rope and twine.</p>


<p>Mexico has rich mines of silver and other minerals. The most valuable mines are in the region of the Sierra Madre.</p>


<p>The leading exports from Mexico to the United States are silver, copper and cattle. Our country sends cloth

<p>The eastern coast lands of Central America receive plentiful rains from the trade winds; in summer this land has also rainfall from the equatorial rain belt.</p>


<p>Among the ranges of Central America are many upland valleys covered with fine and fertile soil that consists mainly of ashes from volcanoes. Many white people, Indians and Negroes live in these upland valleys.</p>


<p>In parts of Central America are found ruins of temples and idols made by Indians who held the land when the white men first went there; most of these ruins are now overgrown with trees and other vegetation.</p>


<p>Lake Nicaragua is part of a route that has been selected for a canal between the two oceans.</p>


<p>Central America consists of the five republics of Guatemala, Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. A large part of the foreign trade is with the United States. These small tropical countries send us coffee, bananas, rubber, mahogany and indigo. In return our country sends them cloth and hardware.</p>

<p>The long chains of islands which separate the Atlantic ocean from the gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean sea are called the <hi rend="italic">West Indies</hi>. These islands are in several groups, the northern being the <hi rend="italic">Bahamas</hi>; next in order follow the great islands of Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica and Porto Rico, with their border islets, together forming the <hi rend="italic">greater Antilles</hi>; lastly, the many smaller islands of the <hi rend="italic">Lesser Antilles</hi> extend from Porto Rico almost to the coast of South America.</p>

<p>At the close of the recent war with Spain, Porto Rico and its border islands were ceded to the United States; Cuba became a republic under the protection of our country.</p>


<p><hi rend="bold">Porto Rico.</hi> This island and some of the small neighboring islands have already been studied. <hi rend="italic">See lesson 82.</hi></p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Cuba.</hi> Cuba, the "Pearl of the Antilles," is the largest island of the West Indies. It is almost as large as Pennsylvania.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-133-c" place="right middle of the page"><figDesc>Century plants</figDesc></figure>

<p>The island may be roughly divided into three regions,&mdash;mountainous in the east, hilly in the middle, mostly level in the west or southwest. Its highest range follows the southeast coast. A few peaks rise about a mile and a half above the sea level.</p>


<p>The coast of Cuba is largely fringed with coral reefs, rocks and sand bars, making navigation difficult; but there are many harbors that rank among the finest in the world. The <hi rend="italic">Isle of Pines</hi>, or Isla de Pinos, is under the government of Cuba.</p>


<p>Cuba is in the torrid zone, and its lowlands have hot or warm weather almost all the year, with plentiful rainfall. The vegetation is luxuriant. Sugar cane and tobacco are the principal crops. Some coffee is raised. Oranges, pineapples, bananas and other fruits abound. The sweet potato is one of the most useful products of the island. Many parts have excellent pasture lands.</p>


<p>The shore waters and streams yield many kinds of food fish. Iron is found in the southeast part of the island.</p>


<p>There are about a million and a half people in Cuba, two thirds of them being of Spanish descent and the other third mostly Negroes, with several thousand coolies, or laborers from China and the East Indies. The people are peaceful and industrious. They are gathered chiefly in

the coast cities and on the plantations of sugar cane and tobacco.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Havana </hi>is the capital and largest city of Cuba. It contains about one sixth of the people of the island. This is also the railroad center as well as the chief port.</p>

<p>Havana owes its growth largely to its fine harbor, its nearness to rich plantations, its nearness to the United States, and the fact that it has long been the capital of the island. The greater part of its trade is with the United States. Its principal exports are cane sugar and tobacco. Most of its imports are manufactured articles.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Santiago </hi>is the second largest city in Cuba and is the leading port of the eastern province.  It exports sugar. This city is on one of the deepest and best-sheltered harbors in all America.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-134-a" place="upper left of the page"><figDesc>Hauling mahogany logs, Cuba</figDesc></figure>

<p>With the destruction of the Spanish fleet when trying to escape from Santiago harbor during the late war, and with the surrender of Santiago itself, the power of Spain in the New World was broken.</p>

<p>The other principal ports of Cuba are <hi rend="bold">Cienfuegos</hi>, on the south coast, and <hi rend="bold">Matanzas </hi>and <hi rend="bold">Cardenas</hi>, on the north coast east of Havana. All these ports ship immense quantities of sugar.</p>

<p>Among the most important inland cities of the island are <hi rend="bold">Santa Clara</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Puerto Principe</hi>. These cities are reached by railroads from the coast.</p>

<p>The Bahama islands, Jamaica, Barbados and most of the Leeward and Windward islands belong to Great Britain, though some of the smaller islands belong to other nations of Europe. <hi rend="bold">Nassau </hi>is the chief port of the Bahamas; and <hi rend="bold">Kingston</hi>, of Jamaica.</p>

<p>The island of Haiti comprises the two small republics of Haiti and Santo Domingo. There are nearly as many people in the island of Haiti as in Cuba. The republic of Haiti is settled chiefly by Negroes; Santo Domingo has a mixed population of Negroes and people of Spanish descent. The latter outnumber the former.	<hi rend="bold">Port au Prince</hi>, in Haiti, and <hi rend="bold">Santo Domingo</hi>, in the eastern republic, are the principal cities of the island.</p>

<p>Bermuda is the name given to a group of islands far to the northeast of the Bahamas. They belong to Great Britain. These islands are a noted health resort, as they have a very even climate.</p>

<p>When white men first went to the West Indies they found there none of the great mammals so common elsewhere in America. Of course the islands are now well stocked with domestic animals. Birds of beautiful plumage are plentiful. Fish and turtles abound and are valuable food products.</p>


<p>The early explorers in the West Indies found many tribes of peaceful Indians, numbering more than a million people. During the first hundred years of white rule this vast population almost disappeared. Other Indians were imported only to die in slavery. After a time large numbers of African Negroes were taken there as slaves, to work on the coffee, sugar and tobacco plantations. Slavery no longer exists in the islands.</p>

</hi></p>
<p>Review lesson 14 and tell what you can about the highlands and lowlands of South America.
</p>
<p>The isthmus of Panama joins the two parts of America. This hilly neck of land is only about thirty miles wide. A railroad crosses from shore to shore. An attempt has also been made to dig a ship canal through the isthmus. Of what use would such a canal be? What waters would it join? On which coast is the city of Panama? Of what country is this isthmus a part? The corner inset map on page 139 shows the railroad and canal routes.
</p>
<p>The Andes highland extends about one fifth of the way round the earth. It consists mainly of a great mountain system, with many long and high valleys between its ranges. In Colombia the Andes divide into three main ranges. The long valleys between them are drained by the Magdalena river and its branches; the main stream is navigable for many miles from the sea and is the chief waterway in this country.
</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-137-a" place="middle on right of left column of page"></figure>
<p>Southward towards Ecuador the mountains unite in a massive chain near the coast. In this chain are many noted volcanoes.
</p>
<p>One of the most important of the high valleys of the Andes is that of Quito, a little less than two miles above sea level. A group of large volcanoes, some of which are very active, surrounds this valley. Of these, Cotopaxi is the loftiest <hi rend="italic">active </hi>volcano known. It is about twice as high as the floor of the valley in which the city of Quito has been built. The summit of its great cone is buried in snow and is often hidden by clouds.
</p>
<p>Another famous peak is Chimborazo, higher than Cotopaxi, but not active. Many earthquakes occur in this volcanic region.

<p>The highest and widest part of the plateau of the Andes is in Peru and Bolivia. This is the highest plateau in America and is bordered both on the east and the west by lofty ranges. It averages about 12,000 feet in height and is three times as high as the Great Basin of North America.</p>

<p>Lake Titicaca (<hi rend="italic">see lesson 14</hi>) is in this plateau between Peru and Bolivia. This is the largest lake in South America and is the loftiest <hi rend="italic">large</hi> body of water in the New World, but some of the lakes in the highland of Tibet are still higher. Steamboats navigate the lake, and a railroad leads down to the coast. The steamers and the cars connect at the town of Puno, which is shown in one of the pictures on this page.</p>

<p>Although high, this plateau is too near the equator to be very cold, but the tops of the mountains rising above it are buried in snow. This region yields much silver ore.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-138-a" place="middle of the page"></figure>

<p>For more than a thousand miles along the west slope of the middle Andes stretches a region known as the <hi rend="italic">rainless coast</hi>. The desert of Atacama, at the southern end of this dry belt, merges into the fertile plains of central Chile.</p>

<p>The Andes chain between Chile and Argentina is narrow but very high.</p>

<p>Years ago the journey across this highland between the two countries was made on mules or on horses, but trains now cross the Andes through the mountain passes.</p>

<p>The pass shown in one of the pictures on this page is not far from the giant volcanic cone of Aconcagua and is two miles and a half above sea level. There are many other volcanoes in this region, and earthquakes are common.</p>

<p>The Andes chain in southern Chile has settled partly beneath the sea. The water flowing into the valleys has made many bays and straits around the southern end of the continent; some of the ridges and peaks that the sea
did not entirely cover form a fringe of islands.</p>

<p>Cape Horn is on one of these rocky islands. Near this cape the sea is often made very rough by the strong westerly winds. For this reason, steamships go through the strait of Magellan instead of rounding the cape. Small bands of Indians and the few colonies of white people live on the islands south of this strait.</p>

<p>The Falkland islands, a few hundred miles to the eastward of the strait of Magellan, belong to Great Britain.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">89. Highlands of Brazil and Guiana</hi></p>
<p>The highland of Brazil is shaped like a triangle, with one side lying along the east coast. This coastal part is the highest. As a whole, the highland of Brazil has only about one sixth the altitude of the Andes.</p>
<p>The greater part of this highland is a low plateau, from the middle of which long rivers flow northward or southward. Rapids and falls abound in most of the streams and make them unfit for waterways. Except in the middle portion of the highland the streams have worn deep and wide valleys in the plateau, leaving long ridges between them.</p>
<p>The coast ranges of Brazil turn many river branches inland. These streams reach the sea by flowing round the ends of the ranges. Thus, the San Francisco river winds northward through a wide valley a thousand miles long before it finds an opening to the sea. Branches of the Parana also are inland by the coast ranges farther south and reach the sea through the broad mouth of the Plata river.</p>
<p>The Guiana highland is, for the most part, a low and much-worn plateau, with
plumes flat-topped hills and mountains rising in high cliffs. The general trend of these mountains is parallel with the Amazon river.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Topics</hi>:&mdash;Highland of Brazil and Andes; surface of highland of Brazil; rivers; Guiana highland.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">90. Selvas, Pampas and Llanos</hi></p>
<p>The slopes east of the crest off the Andes are mainly in three great river basins. The divides between these basins are the highlands of Brazil and Guiana.</p>
<p>The highest parts of the basin of the Amazon are in the Andes; the lowest parts are in swamps along the coast. This river basin includes about one third of the continent. No other river in the world drains so much land as the Amazon, or carries so much water to the ocean.</p>
<p>Steamers go up the Amazon from the sea to the foothills of the Andes; also up some of the larger tributaries. The length of navigable streams in the Amazon system is greater than the distance round the earth.</p>
<p>This is one of the great rivers that make flood plains. The streams in this valley are sluggish, and in times of overflow very fine mud settles in the lowlands. In the rainy season some of the streams rise thirty or forty feet and spread far and wide over the flood plains.</p>
<p>The main branches of the Amazon are the Madeira on the south, and the Negro on the north.</p>
<p>What does lesson 14 tell about the selvas?</p>
<p>The forests, or <hi rend="italic">selvas</hi> of the Amazon valley, are found mainly on the flood plains that extend many miles from the stream. These are the largest forests in the world.</p>

<p>Long vines hang from the trees, and reeds and rushes grow in the wet soil, forming a network so thick in some places that one cannot pass through without first cutting a path. Tree ferns and palms in great variety grow in the
 selvas. What does lesson 25 tell about the Indians that  live in this valley?
</p>
<p>The Plata river valley includes most of the region south of the Amazon valley. The former is only about one half as large as the latter. The main stream is the Parana river, which flows into the broad Platy river.</p>
<p>The lowlands of the Platy basin are called <hi rend="italic">pampas</hi>, meaning <hi rend="italic">fields</hi>. The pampas extend also far south of the Platy basin and form one of the best grazing regions in the world. The greater part of this region is a coastal plain.</p>
<p>Many of the rivers that flow from the Andes towards the pampas dwindle away in the plains and do not reach the sea, because the rainfall there is light and the water evaporates or sinks into the sandy soil. Great plains of sand and gravel extend southward from the pampas to the strait of Magellan. These are known as the plains of Patagonia. There are fertile lands in the flood plains of the streams that cross this plain.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">llanos</hi>, or plains of the Orinoco, spread round the Guiana highland on the north and west. This level land was formed under the sea and rose as a level coastal plain.</p>
<p>The Orinoco rises in the Guiana highland and flows round the western end of this highland on the way to the sea. This is one of the rivers that are making large deltas.</p>

<p>The divides between the three great river basins of this continent are so low in places that the eye cannot detect the slope. In fact the little Cassiquiari river unites the Orinoco with a branch of the Amazon. By carrying a canoe past a few rapids and also three miles overland in one place, a person might make .a canoe journey from the delta of the Orinoco to the mouth of the Plata river.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">91. Climate</hi></p>
<p>Refer to the maps on page 28 amid tell which river basins and highlands of South America are wholly or partly within the torrid zone. What desert of this continent is crossed by the tropic of Capricorn?</p>
<p>In what belt of winds are the Andes of middle and southern Chile? See maps on page 31. Study the maps on page 31 and tell in what season the equatorial rain belt is over the Orinoco basin; over the southern half of the Amazon basin.</p>
<p>From over what ocean do the rain-bearing winds blow into the Amazon valley? Over the highland of Brazil?</p>
<p>Study the map of ocean currents on page 32 and state against which coast of South America cold currents of water flow; warm currents. What effect must the ocean currents have on the westerly winds blowing inland over Chile? On the trade winds blowing over the tropical portion of South America?</p>
<p>The greater part of South America has the hot or warm climate of the torrid zone. Only the narrow southern part
extends as far south as the cool belt.</p>
<p>The northern and middle parts of South America are in the path of the trade wields and as a rule have plentiful rainfalls, except on the western slope of the Andes.The southern part of the continent, beyond the tropic of Capricorn, is mostly in the path of the westerly winds which give rains to the western slopes of the Andes.</p>
<p>A cold polar current flows northward in the Pacific, past the coast of Chile. The westerly winds that blow inland over Chile are cooled by this current. Becoming warmer as it approaches and enters the torrid zone, the current passes the coast of Peru and then mingles with the vast equatorial current that flows westward across the Pacific.</p>
<p>The maps on page 31 show that in summer the equatorial rain belt is north of the equator and gives plentiful rainfall to the llanos, but south of the equator during the northern winter, leaving the llanos dry in that season.</p>
<p>The Orinoco valley well illustrates the effect of the shifting of the equatorial rain belt north and south of the equator. When the sun is north of the equator the llanos are visited by the rain belt, with its almost daily rains. The rivers are then swollen by heavy rains and spread far and wide over their flood plains. Immense herds of cattle and droves of sheep feed on the rich grass which springs up all over the wet plains. The region then teems with life.</p>
<p>As the sun's rays become more and more slanting, the rains leave the llanos and move southward. The overflow in the lowland is slowly drained off. The rivers then grow smaller and shrink away from their banks. The smaller streams leave only parched beds, with here and there muddy pools.</p>
<p>During the dry season a great change takes place in the life on the plains. Hot trade winds scorch the grass and other plants.
They die down to the roots and thus await the return of the rains. Turtles and snakes bury themselves in the mud. The
cattle and the sheep move into the flood plains or are driven to the grass lands among the border foothills. The plain becomes
almost a desert.</p>
<p>The time of heaviest rainfall over the highland of Brazil and the greater part of the Amazon valley is during the southern summer, though most parts of the region are well watered throughout the year.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">92. Plant Life</hi></p>
<p>The plant regions of this continent may be roughly divided into the great forest areas in the valley of the Amazon and on the slopes of the Andes; and the grass lands of the Plata basin, the highland of Brazil and the Orinoco basin.</p>
<p>Among the important trees of the northern and middle Andes are the cacao, from the fruit of which cocoa and chocolate are made, and the cinchona tree, from the bark of which the bitter medicine called <hi rend="italic">quinine</hi> is made. <hi rend="italic">See picture on page 138</hi>.</p>
<p>Large rubber trees and dyewoods grow near the hot and moist banks of the Amazon. <hi rend="italic">See lesson 32.</hi></p>
<p>Rosewood trees also grow in the selvas. Piano cases, chairs and tables are often carved from rosewood, because it takes such a fine
polish. Wood that is used in making choice furniture is called cabinet wood. Many kinds of trees in Brazil supply beautiful cabinet woods.</p>
<p>Many useful plants are raised in the highland of Brazil, chiefly in the rainy eastern part. Among these are coffee, sugar cane, cotton and cassava.</p>
<p>Coffee is the leading product in this region. What does lesson 32 tell about coffee?</p>
<p>The coffee of Brazil grows best on the warm and rainy slopes of the low hills and the plateau at quite a distance from the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>Cassava is one of the chief articles of food used by poor people in Brazil. Tapioca is made from the root of this plant.</p>
<p>Pepper and other spices are raised in the Guianas. Coffee, sugar cane and bananas are produced in all the countries in the northern part of this continent.</p>
<p>The grass lands in the Orinoco valley, the highland of Brazil and the Plata valley support millions of cattle, horses and sheep.</p>
<p>The valley of the Plana river and the narrow plain of middle Chile produce immense quantities of wheat, corn and other grains.

<p>93. Animal Life</p>
<p>In the lofty highland along the west coast of South America are found two animals, the llama and alpaca, that belong to the same family as the camel.</p>
<p>These animals well illustrate how the parts of the body adapt the creature to its home. In place of soft pads to protect their feett from hot sand they have tough pads on their feet, to help them climb rocky places, where they go to find grass.</p>
<p>The cool climate of the mountains cannot harm these two animals, for they are covered with wool.</p>
<p>Large flocks of alpacas are kept for their wool by the people living in the mountains. This is clipped and woven into cloth.</p>
<p>Llamas were at one time used in great numbers to carry silver ore from the mountain mines to the coast. Trains of cars and mules now do most of this work.</p>
<p>The condor, largest of flying birds, is often seen among the peaks of the Andes. This bird is so strong that it sometimes kills sheep and deer that graze in the mountain valleys.</p>
<p>In the forests and grassy plains east of the Andes are found large numbers of animals. Monkeys are numerous.
There are parrots, toucans and many other birds, as well as bright-colored insects without number. Alligators are common in the rivers.</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-142-a"></figure>
<p>The Indians in this region hunt the tapir for its skin and meat.</p>
<p>This animal lives chiefly in the forests, as it feeds on buds, leaves and tender shoots of plants.</p>
<p>Great serpents, called boas, are sometimes seen crushing ant-eaters and other animals.</p>
<p>The boa has no poison fangs, but it coils its long body round the animals and slowly crushes them to death.</p>
<p>The ant-eater has sharp claws with which it tears open ant-hills.</p>
<p>Then it thrusts in a long sticky tongue and gathers up the little insects for food.</p>
<p>A large catlike animal,called the <hi rend="italic">jaquar</hi>, is found in nearly all parts of South America, as it can feed on small animals. In the far south is seen the large running bird that looks like an ostrich. It is known as the <hi rend="italic">rhea</hi>.</p>
<p>Cattle and sheep in great numbers graze on the open plains of this continent. These animals are not native there, but were brought by white settlers from Europe.</p>

 <p><hi rend="bold">94. People</hi></p>
<p>The white people form the leading class in all the countries of South America. As a rule, they have settled within a few hundred miles of the coast and there built most of their cities and towns. Many of the cities of the western countries are located in valleys in the Andes, far above the hot and sickly lowlands along the coast.</p>

are developing this section. The great country of Brazil was settled by Portuguese, or people from Portugal, and
their language is still spoken there. Spanish people have, to a large extent, settled the other countries of South America.
</p>
<p>Slavery was at one time common in nearly all parts of South America, and millions of Negroes were taken from their homes in Africa to this continent. They were used by the white people as laborers. Now they are free, and they have made their homes near the places where they toiled. They form a large part of the population in nearly all countries of South America. <hi rend="italic">See map on page 35</hi>.</p>
<p>Indians of various tribes are widespread over this continent. Many live in the same districts as the white men and the Negroes, but far the greater number are found in the selvas.</p>
<p>When the white men from Spain first went into the highland of Peru and Bolivia they found there a race of Indians whose rulers were called Incas, and the same name was given to all the people ruled by the Incas. These Indians had built cities of smoothed stone, and they had made excellent roads and bridges in the mountains. Cuzco was their chief city, and it still contains ruins of their beautiful stonework.</p>
<p>The white men were very cruel to the Indians and made slaves of them. The descendants of the Incas still live in this highland. Some work in the silver mines; others gather large quantities of Peruvian bark and cacao for market.Except the three Guianas, all countries of South America are republics, with governments similar in many respects to the government of the United States.</p>

 <p><hi rend="bold">96. Highlands of Europe</hi></p>
<p>Europe may be divided into three regions, &mdash; highlands in the southwest and south, lower highlands in the northwest, and lowlands spreading over the rest of the continent, as far as the Ural range.
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-145-a"><figDesc>Scene in the Alps (Jungfrau) </figDesc></figure></p>
<p>Review lesson 15 and tell what you can about the surface Europe.</p>
<p>The Alps form the mountain center of southwest Europe; they are about as high as the Rocky mountains of Colorado.
</p>
<p>Among the Alps are great snow-capped mountains down whose sides long glaciers slowly wind, melting in the valleys. Mt. Blacc, the loftiest of these peaks, is about three miles high. Snow and ice bury the upper half of this great peak and the many other peaks around it.</p>
<p>The Alps are pierced by several railroad tunnels. The St. Gotthard tunnel is nearly ten miles long, &mdash;the longest in the world. It connects the plateau of Switzerland with the basin of the Po river. Mt. Cenis tunnel is near the western end of the Po basin.</p>
<p>Along the southern border of the Alps are many lakes that are world-famed for their beauty. Among these are lakes Como, Garda and Maggiore.</p>
<p>There are many famous passes over the Alps. Since the building of railroads, these lofty passes have been little used by travelers.</p>
<p>The Alps are famous for their scenery. They abound in lakes, waterfalls and glaciers.</p>
<p>The western part of the Alps bends southward between the valleys of the Po and the Rhone.</p>
<p>Monaco, the smallest state in Europe, with an area of only eight square miles, is near the southeast corner of France, where these mountains reach the sea. The city of Monaco, in the state of the same name, occupies a rocky headland, as shown in the picture.
</p>



<p>On the western side of the Rhone valley in France rises the broad range known as the Cevennes. The Jura mountains extend from the valley of the Rhone into that of the Rhine. This range consists chiefly of low folds, like many of the Allegheny ridges.</p>
<p>The Rhone is so rapid that only strong steamers can stem its current above its delta plain. This river rises in the Alps and flows through the beautiful lake Geneva.</p>
<p>The river Rhine flows from lake Constance. This stream and also some of its branches have worn deep valleys in a broad rolling upland reaching almost to its great delta plain. The Rhine is navigable to the border of the Swiss plateau.</p>
<p>The Karpathian mountains partly separate the highlands of southern-Europe from the great plains of eastern Europe. The lowland part of the Danube basin lying southwest of these mountains is known as the <hi rend="italic">plain of Hungary.</hi></p>
<p>This plain was formerly the bed of a great lake. It is now one of the most fertile parts of Europe and supports nearly one fourth as many people as there are in the United States. The Danube and its branches form a waterway to almost every part of the plain. The main river affords an outlet eastward to the Black sea. At the place where the Danube leaves the plain of Hungary the river has cut a long gorge across the range. This gorge is known as the<hi rend="italic"> Iron Gate</hi>.</p>
<p>In the gorge the river flows swiftly over a rocky bed, forming rapids. A canal has been built at great expense, to carry vessels past the rapids. This river has built a great delta.</p>
<p>South of the lower part of the Danube rises the lofty Balkan range of mountains. This is the highest range in the peninsula between the Black and the Adriatic seas.</p>
<p>The name <hi rend="italic">Balkan peninsula</hi> is often applied to the lands that extend southward from the Balkan range to Greece; but this is <figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-145-b"><figDesc>Monaco</figDesc></figure> also known as the <hi rend="italic">Turkish peninsula</hi>. Among the mountains of this region are many fertile lowland valleys.</p>
<p>The Alps curve round the western part of the fertile Po valley and unite with the long range of the Apennines that runs through the entire length of the peninsula of Italy.</p>
<p>On the northeast slope of the Apennines, not far from the so of the Tiber, lies the small free state of San Marino. It covers only 32 square miles and has a population of about 10,000.</p>

<p>The Apennines have no such lofty peaks as the Alps. There are many volcanoes in southern Italy and the neighboring islands, but there is only one <hi rend="italic">active</hi> volcano on the <hi rend="italic">mainland</hi> of Europe. This is <hi rend="italic">Vesuvius</hi>, near the beautiful bay of Naples, on the southwest coast of Italy.</p>
<p>Long ages ago an eruption of Vesuvius <note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-147-1"></note>
 buried three cities. When the eruption ceased the layers of mud, ashes and lava were so deep that no trace of the houses could be found. Centuries passed, and people no longer knew where the cities were buried; but beneath new vineyards and groves lay many works of art and the ruins of temples, homes, baths and paved streets. Some of these, especially in Pompeii, have now been dug Vesuvius  up, and they teach us a great deal about the customs of the Roman people who lived there in that early time.<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-147-b"><figDesc>Vesuvius</figDesc></figure></p>

<p>After this terrible eruption Vesuvius was quiet for fifteen hundred years; then it again became active and killed thousands of people. Now and then the volcano breaks forth, but not with such violence as in ancient times.  Mt. Etna, on the island of Sicily, is the loftiest volcano in Europe, yet it is only a little more than half as high as Chimborazo.</p>
<p>Among the mountains of southwest Europe the Pyrenees rank next in height to the Alps, and form a lofty barrier between France and Spain. Railroad lines have been built round the end of the Pyrenees range.</p>
<p>Far in among these mountains is the little state of Andorra. It occupies a few small but elevated valleys. There are only a few thousand people in the entire state, and most of them are shepherds. In name, Andorra is a free state, but it pays tribute both to France and to a Spanish bishop.  A few hundred thousand industrious people known as Basques live near the bay of Biscay in northern Spain and southern France. They are probably the descendants of early tribes of white people that once held the Spanish peninsula.</p>
<p>The Spanish peninsula is mostly a broad plateau with a border of narrow coastal plains on the east and on the west. Mountain ranges almost inclose the upland region, and other ranges extend across it.</p>
<p>The broad upland is swept by chilly winter winds and is parched by summer sunshine.(<hi rend="italic">Continued on page 148.</hi>)</p>

<p>Long ago Spain was conquered by people called Moors, from northern Africa, and some of the buildings made by them may still be seen. Grandest of all is the Aihambra, the palace and fortress of the Moorish kings. It is in the city of Granada, near the Sierra Nevada. This was the last stronghold of the Moors in Spain and was captured the year that Columbus first set sail for the New World.</p>
<p>The west and southwest coasts of Spain receive heavy rainfalls; the slopes of the east are dry, but the Moors constructed immense reservoirs in the uplands, and even to-day the water is led from these reservoirs to irrigate the eastern lowlands.
</p>
<p>On the southern coast of Spain, near the strait of Gibraltar, a small but famous peninsula extends into the sea. The body of the peninsula consists of a mass of rock, known as the rock of Gibraltar. It is a fortress held by the British nation.</p>
<p>The river valleys in this peninsula, as well as the narrow coastal plain, are small but very fertile.</p>
<p>The Scandinavian peninsula, containing the two countries Norway and Sweden, is more than a thousand miles long. The highland of this peninsula consists mainly of a rugged plateau deeply cut by river valleys. Along most parts of the Atlantic coast the plateau rises abruptly from the sea; but towards the east it descends in gentler slopes across which flow many rivers to the gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic sea.</p>

<p>The west coast of Norway is one of many coasts formed by rugged land settling partly beneath the sea, thus letting the waters flow into deep valleys, making almost countless bays and peninsulas. These deep and long bays in Norway are called fords. The Sogne fiord is the longest and reaches more than a hundred miles inland. A large part of the plateau is buried in ice and snow; streams leap down the cliffs into the valleys, and many glaciers also creep slowly towards the sea.</p>
<p>Along the west coast of this great peninsula extends a series of banks over which the sea is shallow. Beyond them the water is
very deep. These banks abound in fish.</p>
<p>This peninsula has mines that yield iron of a very high grade.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">97. Lowlands of Europe</hi></p>
<p>The lowlands of Europe may be said to begin near the Pyrenees mountains and to curve northeastward round the Alpine highland, through France, Germany and the small countries along the southeast shore of the North sea, thence spreading over the great country of Russia to the Arctic shore on the north and to the Black and Caspian seas on the south. The rivers shown on the map are the best guide to the slope of the land. What is the general slope of this plain in France? In Germany? In southern Russia? In northern Russia?</p>

In what hills does the Volga river rise? Describe its course. This is one of the rivers that have built great deltas. Describe the course of the Dwina. What large seas receive rivers that rise in or near the Valdai hills?
</p>
<p>France and Germany extend from the Alpine highland as broad rolling uplands, in which many of the rivers have cut deep valleys. Towards the coast in these countries, as well as in the small countries along the southeast shore of the North sea, the plain is lower and more level. These lower parts are mostly coastal plains, though the region round the mouth of the Rhine is an immense delta plain formed by that river.</p>
<p>Large quantities of coal and iron are found in the southern part of Germany, in Belgium and in France. Great manufacturing cities
have grown up in the vicinity of these mines, and among their products are machines, tools, hardware and cutlery. These three
countries are noted for their iron manufactures. Germany also yields large quantities of copper, lead and zinc.</p>

<p>The great plain of Russia includes one half of the continent of Europe. The northern portion of this plain consists of frozen treeless tundras like those along the Arctic coast of America. South of the tundras are the wooded plains which also stretch far eastward across Siberia. The southern half of the plain of Russia is mostly prairie land. Round the salt Caspian sea spread salty lands called <hi rend="italic">steppes</hi>, large areas of which are below sea level.</p>
<p>The Volga river, with its network of canals, forms the main waterway through the Russian plain. These water routes lead to all the border seas. The canals cross from river to river, so that boats can carry freight to almost every city and large town in Russia.</p>
<p>On the west the inland waterways of Russia connect with the Vistula system. Boats from the Vistula can pass through tributaries and canals that lead into the Oder, thence to the Elbe and the Rhine. All the large rivers of Germany thus help to form connected system, reaching nearly all ports of the country and affording a cheap means of transporting freight.</p>
<p>The low countries of Belgium and the Netherlands, or Holland, are crossed by many canals. From the Rhine valley canals lead to the Seine, thence to the Loire and to the Garonne. From the latter river boats can follow the canal route to the Rhone river or to the Mediterranean sea. The Rhine and the Danube are also connected by a canal in the highland region, thus completing the water route from the North sea to the Black sea, the plain of Hungary. All these canals are of great service.</p>

<p>The island of Great Britain is in three divisions. What range of hills separates Scotland from England? Where is Wales?</p>
<p>Most of the high land in Great Britain is in the north and west parts. The south and east parts of the island are mostly low or slightly hilly land.</p>
<p>The northern portion of Scotland is very rugged, but it contains no lofty chain like the Alps. It consists largely of rounded peaks and flat-topped uplands deeply cut by streams. Ben-Nevis is the highest point of land in the British Isles, but it is not quite two thirds as high as Mt. Mitchell. The southern part of Scotland consists of rolling or hilly lowlands.
</p>
<p>The mountains in England and Wales are little more than high hills. Southward from the Cheviot hills the highland merges into the lowland.</p>
<p>One of the richest coal and iron regions of the world extends from southern Scotland across northern England to Wales. Great Britain ranks next to the United States in coal and iron production. Among the products of the iron and steel works of Great Britain are machines, tools, hardware and cutlery.</p>
<p>The groups of low mountains or hills in Ireland are mostly near the coast. The inland district is a plain.</p>
<p>Large areas of plain in Ireland are low and boggy. They are so level that they cannot even be drained and are therefore of little value for farming or grazing. Thick layers of decaying moss cover the bogs and supply a kind of fuel known as peat or <hi rend="italic">black turf</hi>.</p>
<p>Ireland is often called the <hi rend="italic">Emerald Isle</hi>, because the grass there is green all the year. Parts of the inland district form fine grazing lands, and the country is noted for its dairy products.</p>
<p>The soil in many parts of Ireland is suited to the growth of flax. Flax ranks next in value to cotton, for cloth making. The flax grown in Ireland is made into the fine linen for which the city of Belfast has long been noted.</p>

Refer to the maps on page 31 and tell from what direction most of the winds blow over Europe. Which side of the continent must receive the most rainfall? What does lesson 23 say about the effect of the Gulf stream and the climate of Europe?</p>
<p>Western Europe is in the path of winds from over the Atlantic. These winds give plentiful rainfall to most parts of the western half of Europe, but farther inland the rains become less, and the eastern half of the plain of Russia often suffers from long drouths. The region around the Caspian sea has only light rainfall.</p>
<p>Southern Europe has a climate similar to that of the Southern states of our own country; middle Europe, like that of the prairies south of the Great Lakes; northern Europe, like that of the region stretching northward from the Great Lakes to the Arctic ocean.</p>
<p>The rainfall from the westerly winds is very heavy on the highlands of the British Isles and the Scandinavian peninsula. Although the northern part of this peninsula lies within the Arctic circle, its western slope has a mild climate, largely due to the winds blowing shoreward from over the waters that drift far northward from the Gulf stream. This stream also gives a mild climate to the British Isles.</p>
<p>In winter the sea and gulf on the east of the peninsula, as well as the wide straits leading into them, are frozen over, for here the mild winds from the ocean do not enter.</p>

<p>Wheat, rye and other grains are widespread over the lowlands of Europe, as well as in the river valleys of all the Mediterranean countries. The grain region includes the river valleys of the Spanish peninsula, the Po and Danube valleys and the great plain spreading through France, Germany and Russia.</p>
<p>All the countries of southwest Europe, from Spain to southwest Russia, produce immense quantities of grapes. Most of these are used in making wine. Many are also dried and sold as raisins. The valley of the Rhine in Germany, the plains of southern France, the plain of Hungary and the sunny slope of Spain and Italy are famous for their vineyards. The small raisins of Greece are called currants, &mdash;a corruption of the word Corinth. Currants are the most valuable product which Greece sends to other countries.</p>
<p>Millions of tons of sugar beets are raised each year in the plains spreading round the Alpine highlands, especially in the plain of Hungary, southwest Russia, Germany, France and the delta of the Rhine.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean countries are famous for their oranges, lemons, olives and other fruits.Large quantities of tobacco are raised in the Turkish peninsula, the plain of Hungary and in many parts of the great plain of Europe.</p>
 <p>Flax from which linen cloth and many fine laces are made is raised in Ireland and in the plain spreading round the Alpine highlands, especially in France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.</p>
<p>Forests of pine and other soft-wood trees extend in a wide belt from Norway eastward across Sweden, northern Russia and the plain of Siberia, merging on the north into the frozen tundras along the Arctic coast.</p>
<p>Dense forests both of hard-wood and soft-wood trees grow on the sides of most of the mountains of southern Europe, except, of
course, on the high and cold Alpine summits. There are also large forests in the rougher portions of the plains near the highlands.
</p>
<p>The great plain of Europe and many valleys in and round the highlands produce abundant grass for millions of cattle, horses and sheep. The best grass lands are in southern Russia, the plain of Hungary in the middle Danube basin, the valley of the Po, the valleys of the Alpine highland and the plains on the north and west of the Alps.</p>
<p>The grassy plains of middle and southern Russia support millions of geese. Most of them are shipped to German markets.</p>

<p>What do lessons 27 and 28 tell about the people of Europe? What does lesson 30 say of the governments?</p>
<p>Far the greater number of people in Europe belong to the white race. That continent is the home of many of the most enlightened and civilized nations of the world.</p>
<p>In the northern part of Norway, Sweden and Russia, in the districts marked Finland and Lapland on the map, page 149, live many people of the yellow race, known as <hi rend="italic">Finns</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lapps</hi>. These people, especially in Finland, have built many towns and some large cities.</p>
<p>Many people called <hi rend="italic">Tartars</hi> have: moved westward from Asia into Russia, settling chiefly in the basin of the Volga.</p>
 <p>In the plains of Hungary there are remnants of tribes of yellow people that settled there long ago. They have made about the same progress as the
white people that live on the same plains and that now greatly outnumber the yellow people.</p>
<p>The Turks, or native people of Turkey, belong to the yellow race, but many white people live in the same country.</p>
<p>With the exceptions above noted, the nations of Europe belong to the white race.
</p>
<p>There are nearly five times as many people in Europe as in the United States. Europe is thus much more thickly settled than our own country.</p>
<p>We have seen (<hi rend="italic">lesson 30</hi>) that France and Switzerland are republics; that Russia and Turkey are absolute monarchies; and that all the other countries of Europe are limited monarchies. The Turks are Mohammedans; most of the churches in all the other countries of Europe belong to various branches of the Christian religion.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">102. Cities of the British Isles</hi></p>
<p>The government of the British Isles is a limited monarchy. The ruler holds office by claim of birth, but his authority is limited by a constitution which gives the lawmaking power to a Parliament.</p>
<p>Parliament consists of two bodies,&mdash;the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The members of the former are elected by the people; the members of the latter are nobles and bishops.</p>

<p>The British Isles constitute the <hi rend="italic">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. </hi>The United Kingdom, with all British colonies and other possessions, forms the British empire. The ruler of this empire appoints a <hi rend="italic">Governor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">a Governor-General</hi> for each colony or dependency. Some of the colonies take no part in governing themselves. Others elect their own officers, except Governors; but the British ruler retains authority to veto any bill passed by a colonial government.</p>
<p>The large British possessions, such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, have Parliaments of their own.</p>
<p>The foreign commerce of the British Isles is carried on mostly through the great ports of London, Liverpool and Glasgow.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">London</hi>, the capital of the British empire,controls most of the British trade with India, Australia and the mainland of Europe; also a large part of the trade with tropical America.</p>
<p>London, with its great trade, has grown to be the largest city and one of the chief seaports in the world.</p>

have learned that the air near the surface of the earth is much denser than at a great height above the surface. It is thought that about one half of all the air and three fourths of all the moisture in the air are below the level of the top of the Himalaya range.</p>
<p>Just north of the Himalaya chain the Indus and Brahmaputra rivers, the former flowing westward and the latter eastward, have cut deep valleys in the plateau and deep gorges through the mountains, thus reaching the lowlands on the south. The upper parts of these rivers are fed chiefly by snow melting on the lofty mountains. Along the sides of these streams are found most of the people who live in the highland of Tibet. They have small gardens and herds of yaks. To the natives of Tibet the yaks are as useful as cattle are to us.</p>
<p>Owing to the high border ranges the plateau of Tibet is dry. Streams from the mountains rum into the valleys, but there is not enough water to overflow some of the wide hollows and reach the sea. The lakes and marshes in these inclosed valleys are therefore salt. In some places, where the lakes and marshes dry away, the surface is covered with layers of white salt.</p>
<p>The lakes in the western part of Tibet are the highest in the world, being about 17,000 feet above sea level.The inner part of Tibet is almost a desert. Owing to its great height it is very cold, except during the days of a short summer season. Herds of wild yaks and musk deer search out the grassy places. Few people live in the inner part of Tibet.</p>
<p>One of the pictures on this page shows part of the vale of Kashmir, situated among the Himalayas, not far from the place where the Indus river crosses the range. The level land of this fertile vale or valley was once the bed of a lake. The river that now wanders across time lake plain is a branch of the Indus. The part shown in the picture is about a mile above sea level, and the water must flow a thousand miles or more before it reaches the sea.</p>
<p>On the east the highland of Tibet sends long streams down the slopes of China. Several large rivers from the highland bend also to the southeast, flowing in long valleys between lofty ranges which extend to the peninsulas of southeast Asia.</p>
<p>At the western end of the highland of Tibet stands the Pamir plateau. We may think of this as the mountain center of Asia. Almost all the loftiest ranges of Asia. Almost all the loftiest ranges of the continent radiate from the Pamir plateau.</p>

<p>The Basin regions of Asia and North America are alike in many respects. They are at about the same distance from the equator, being nearly halfway to the north pole. Their surfaces are broken by low ranges, between which lie long valleys. None of their streams reach the sea, but all waste away or flow into salt lakes or marshes. Strong winds which sweep over portions of the surface lay bare the rocky ledges and drift the sand into dunes. Most of the towns of the Asiatic basin are built near the mountains, where streams flow out into the valleys. These streams are fed by rain or melting snow on the high border ranges.</p>
<p>Less than half the region marked <hi rend="italic">Gobi </hi>on the maps is really a barren waste. The desert runs east and west through the central portion, and even that part is not so barren as the Middle Basin farther west. In eastern Gobi rains sometimes fall in the summer. Grass then springs up and furnishes food for the camels and horses in the caravans which carry tea from China to Siberia, whence it is taken to Russia. Over a large part of the so-called <hi rend="italic">desert of Gobi </hi>camels and sheep eke out a living on grass and bushes.</p>
<p>When it is noon in the Middle Basin it is midnight in the Great Basin of North America. Can you tell why?</p>

<p>The people in the western part of the Basin region of Asia lead a wretched life. Streams flowing at one time may be dry at another, and river valleys may thus become barren. The people are then forced to roam about in search of pastures for their cattle and sheep. The old towns are sometimes buried by drifting sand.</p>
<p>The southwest portion of Asia is mostly a plateau region forming part of the great Asian highland.</p>
<p>Where is the plateau of Iran? What mountains are on the northeast and east? What seas are on the south and southwest?</p>
<p>The plateau of Iran is about one third as high as the plateau of Tibet and is almost inclosed by mountains.</p>
<p>The plateau of Iran resembles the Great Basin of North America. Both have small streams, salt lakes and salt swamps in both the valleys are covered with gravel, sand or finer soil washed from  the ranges; in places the sand drifts into dunes; the people settle chiefly near the ranges, where the mountain streams can easily be used to irrigate the land; canals and ditches lead the water over the cultivated districts; large areas of both regions are dry, but other parts are fertile.</p>
<p>Persia occupies the greater part of the plateau of Iran and extends from the Caspian sea to the Persian gulf on the south west, and an arm of the Arabian sea on the south. Afghanistan and Baluchistan comprise most of the eastern part of this plateau.</p>
<p>In the Suliman range are two important passes through which caravans have gone for centuries. The Bolan pass is one of the chief gateways between the high region of Iran and the low fertile plains south of the Himalaya mountains. <hi rend="italic">See map on page 174. </hi>This pass has been the scene of many fierce conflicts between caravan guards and the natives of the mountain region, but several years ago the native tribes were subdued.</p>
<p>Another low place in the crest of the Suliman range is the famous Khaibar pass northeast of the Bolan. Through this pass the roadway crosses the range at the height of only about half a mile above sea Southwest of the plateau of Iran lies a small but historic river valley sloping to the Persian gulf. The greater part of this valley consists of the flood plains of two rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates.</p>
<p>For many centuries this valley has been peopled by the white race. Long ago the people thrived under strong rulers and made fine systems of canals to irrigate the land. Then the crops of wheat, figs and dates were large; great cities were built and the nation was prosperous. For a long time, however, the rulers have been weak, the land has been overrun by thieving tribes, and the people have allowed the canals to go to ruin. Many parts of the valley that were once fertile have become sandy and barren. The portion of Asia extending westward from the plateau of Iran is almost surrounded by a gulf and four great seas. The region consists mostly of a low plateau, chiefly in the countries of Turkey and Arabia.</p>
<p>Between what seas does the Caucasus mountain range extend? Name three great seas that border on Asiatic Turkey. What small sea and two straits in part separate Turkey in Asia from Turkey in Europe?</p>
<p>As a whole, southwest Asia is not very productive, though many small fertile slopes descend to the border seas. They produce figs, olives and grapes. Many sheep are raised in the grass lands of the plateaus of southwest Asia.  Mt. Ararat, in the northern part of this plateau region, is a volcanic cone a little more than three and a fourth miles high.</p>
<p>Along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean sea is the ancient country of Palestine, famous in Bible history. It is now part of the country of Turkey. The <hi rend="italic">Dead sea, </hi>a salt lake in this region, is in one of the most historic valleys on the earth. The water of this sea is about ten times as
salt as that of the ocean and is also very bitter. The sea is not quite fifty miles long. Its surface is about one fourth of a mile below sea level.</p>
<p>North of the Dead sea is a beautiful lake known as the <hi rend="italic">sea of Galilee. </hi>This lake also is below sea level, but its water is fresh, for the river Jordan forms its outlet and flows into the Dead sea.</p>

 

<pb n="165" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-165" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
<p>The Jordan and the two lakes are in one long valley, shut in by highlands on both sides. One low range near the southwest shore of the Dead sea is made of rock salt and is about six miles in length. Jerusalem and Bethlehem are a few miles west of the northern part of the Dead sea.</p>
<p>In general, the peninsula of Arabia is a desert region, but there are many narrow fertile valleys near the mountain ranges, where dates and wheat are raised and where camels and horses find good grazing lands. The hilly slopes near the entrance to the Red sea have for ages been famous for their crops of coffee.</p>
<p>Some of the fertile valleys of Arabia are thickly settled. Until recent years the chiefs have tried to keep travelers out of the country. Many of the chiefs have great wealth and fine buildings.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">107. Arctic and Caspian Slopes</hi></p>
<p>The northern part of Eurasia consists mainly of a low coastal plain. The Ural mountains run north and south across the plain and form part of the boundary between Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>What does lesson 16 tell about the plain of Siberia? Name three rivers flowing across this plain. Where do they rise? Which of these rivers, through one of its branches, receives the overflow of lake Baikal?</p>
<p>This lake is the largest body of fresh water in Asia, but it is not quite half so large as lake Superior. The water is very deep and abounds in salmon. In summer many seals are caught along its shores. It is curious to find seals in this lake, for they are usually seen only in the oceans.</p>
<p>Russian traders navigate lake Baikal while it is open, and when it freezes they carry on trade by sledges across it. This lake is about one fourth of a mile above sea level and is almost encircled by forested mountain slopes.</p>
<p>Along the Arctic coast of Siberia the dreary frozen tundras resemble the Arctic plains in North America.</p>
<p>Fossil elephants are found in the gravelly river banks of the Siberian tundras. These animals had woolly coverings that fitted them to live in the cold plains. The "woolly elephants" are unlike any now living on the earth; yet the flesh of these great beasts, after having been buried perhaps for many centuries in the frozen ground, is sometimes found well preserved and is eaten
by dogs. The tusks of these fossil elephants have long supplied part of the ivory so finely carved in Japan and China.</p>
<p>South of the tundras, plains covered with forests extend southward to the Altai mountains and southwestward to grassy plains round the Caspian sea.</p>
<p>A railroad extends from Russia across Siberia to the Pacific coast. Except where the railroad now runs, the great rivers form the main highways of trade and travel. Turn to the map on page 163 and you will see that the Ob, Yenisei and Lena rivers branch towards one another in such a manner that, except in two narrow places, there is a waterway from the Ural mountains to the Stanovoi range. In summer many steamers navigate the rivers, and in winter the smoothly frozen surfaces of the streams make excellent roads. The winter travel is mainly on sledges drawn by deer.

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-165-b"><figDesc>Steppes of Siberia</figDesc></figure>
<p>The southwest part of the northern plain of Asia consists of treeless but grassy plains, there called <hi rend="italic">steppes</hi>. They are drained mostly towards the Caspian and Aral seas. As the region is low and far inland it has only light rainfall and is therefore almost treeless. East of the Caspian sea it is desertlike and barren, except where streams from the mountains are led aside in canals to irrigate the land.</p>
<p>The grass in any one part of this region is not sufficient to support the cattle and sheep. The people therefore wander with their herds from place to place, living in tents and carrying their few possessions with them. Such wandering people are called <hi rend="italic">nomads</hi>.</p>
<p>The surface of the Caspian sea is lower than the level of the ocean, but the surface of the Aral sea is higher. Both these seas are salt. The Caspian sea is more than four times as large as lake Superior. Thousands of people earn their living by catching fish in the Caspian sea or in the rivers that flow into it. Many vessels are engaged in carrying freight between the Caspian ports.</p>
<p>The Caspian and Aral seas were once much wider than at present. The Aral sea then had an outlet to the Caspian. For some reason the climate became drier, the seas shrank away, leaving salty plains that yield only coarse grasses. The irrigated lands nearer the mountains yield large crops of grain and grass.The purple tint on the maps of pages 147 and 161 shows what part of the plain round the Caspian sea is below sea level.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">108. Pacific Slope</hi></p>
<p>From Bering strait to the Amur basin the Pacific slope of Asia is very narrow and therefore has no large streams. The Amur basin is so far from the equator that the winters are long and severe. The region is thinly settled and is largely overgrown with forests.</p>
<p>Name two rivers that flow across the plain of China. Where
do these rivers rise? What mountain range divides the middle parts of their basins? Where is the Nanling range?</p>


<pb n="166" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-166" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
<p>The great plain of China is made of soil carried down by the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, mostly by the former. This delta plain contains many thousand square miles and is one of the most thickly settled regions in the world.</p>
 <p>Above the delta plain the Yellow river flows through a district covered with deep yellowish soil. This was brought as dust by the winds from the dry inland basin region. The area covered by this soil is far greater than that of the lava plains of the Columbia plateau region.</p>
<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-c-166-a"><figDesc>Loess beds, Yellow river basin, China</figDesc></figure>
<p>In some places the yellowish soil, called loess, is hundreds of feet in depth. It fills valleys, buries hills and rises far up the slopes of mountain ranges. Rivers have cut deep valleys in it; and in the sides of the valleys, at points which the streams no longer reach, millions of Chinese people have dug caves for homes. This soil is very fertile, and gardens cover a large part of the region.
</p>
<p>The Yellow river has carried down countless tons of the yellowish soil and has made of it the larger part of the great delta plain of China. Each year the plain grows farther into the sea, for no ocean current strong enough to carry away the sediment sweeps past the mouth of the river. Cities in China that were once seaports are now far inland.</p>
<p>The delta plain of the Yellow river, like every other delta plain, slopes gently away on both sides from the muddy river which brings down the soil. Banks have been built along the river to keep it in its proper channel. Several times the water has burst through the banks and rushed in floods over the plain. Cities and towns have been swept away, and many thousand people have been drowned. The Chinese call the river China's sorrow, on account of the destruction and suffering it has caused.
</p>
<p>Each overflow of the Yellow river has given it a new course across the fertile plain and a new mouth about which to deposit sediment and thus build its delta forward. In the course of centuries the river has shifted its mouth three hundred miles back and forth along the coast.</p>
<p> The Yellow river takes its name from the yellowish soil which discolors the water. This river performs its chief work in making delta lands, for it is of little use to steamers entering from the sea. The current in some places is very swift, and numerous bars form, not only at the mouth of the river, but also far upstream.</p>
<p>As the river has often changed its course, and as it is hardly navigable only a few large cities have grown up along its banks.</p>
<p>The Yangtze river built the southern part of the great delta plain of China. This stream forms the best waterway on the eastern slope of Asia and is open to large steamers fro more than a thousand miles from the ocean. Many of the greatest cities in China have grown up on the banks of this river.</p>
<p>Canals extend almost the whole width of the great delta plain of China and form fine waterways. They supply water also for large tracts of land on which rice, millet, vegetables and other products are raised. A large inland trade is carried on by way of these canals and rivers.</p>
<p>Above the delta plain, for a long distance inland, the basins of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers are rolling or hilly. The western portions of the great basins are in the mountainous regions of Tibet.</p>
<p>More than two thousand years ago a high and wide wall was built along the former boundary of China, to shut out fierce Tartar tribes on the north. The wall runs for more than a thousand miles over mountains and through wide valleys. Many parts of the great wall are now crumbling to ruins. See map on page 161.</p>
<p>From the highland of Tibet long mountain ranges extend to the great peninsula of Indo-China, in southeast Asia. Swift streams flow in valleys between the ranges. The longest of these streams is the Mekong river.</p>
<p>The course of the Mekong is in many places broken by rapids. The river is therefore not navigable, except for about 300 miles from its mouth. The Mekong has built a fertile delta plain, but it is not nearly so large as the plain of China.</p>
<p>Farther west in Burma, a part of India, the Irawadi river has built a large delta.</p>

<p>The great country of India is bordered on the north by the Himalayas.In the south is the Dekkan plateau, in the large V-shaped peninsula of Hindustan. Between the Himalayas and the Dekkan are broad plains drained chiefly by the Ganges river.</p>
<p>What two rivers that you have studied rise on the northern slope
of the Himalayas but flow through the range and across India to the sea? Which of these rivers enters the Arabian sea? Which enters the bay of Bengal?</p>
<p>The Ganges river system has built very large flood plains sloping
only a few inches to the mile. When the rains are heavy these plains are flooded far and wide, thus receiving fresh soil from the

 



<pb n="167" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-167" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />
highland slopes The Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers unite in making a large delta in which the streams divide, making a network of branches.</p>
<p>Between the flood plain of the Ganges and the mountains on the north the river basin is covered with waste washed from the lofty range. Near the mountains the coarse waste forms steep slopes, but far out in the valley the finer waste forms very gentle slopes.</p>
<p>The Ganges river is navigable for more than a thousand miles through its great flood plain and is alive with boats carrying products from city to city.
</p>
<p>The Dekkan is mostly a low plateau region separated in part from the rest of India by a hilly range on the north. The peninsula, has low ranges facing the two seas on the east and west.</p>
<p>The Dekkan is highest on the west side, and its main streams therefore flow to the bay of Bengal. The western Ghats rise abruptly from a narrow coastal plain and are little more than the western edge of the Dekkan plateau. Long ages ago great quantities of molten rock poured out of the earth and covered many thousand square miles in this peninsula, just as in the basin of the Columbia river in North America; but the lava-flows of India have crumbled into fine dark soil that is very fertile.</p>
<p>The rivers that flow eastward in this peninsula have made flood plains and deltas of this rich soil, which for ages have yielded immense crops.</p>
<p>The Indus and the Brahmaputra have also made flood plains of great fertility.</p>
<p>Large sand bars form shoals in the bed of the Indus river. Navigation is therefore difficult, but steamers succeed in going up the river as far as a rich wheat country that spreads out from the base of the Himalayas. The Indus has made a delta, though not nearly so large as that of the Ganges.</p>

<p> Long curving chains of islands lie east and southeast of Asia and partly inclose large border seas. These islands contain hundreds of volcanoes, many of which are now active.</p>  
  <p>The islands in the Japan group consist mainly of old volcanic hilly country, but there are also many wide plains.</p>
<p>The rivers of Japan, though short, are useful in floating logs of cedar and pine from the hilly districts to the sawmills near the coast. Large flat-bottomed boats on these streams also carry the produce of the plains down to the seaports.</p>
<p>Fujiyama, a noted volcano of Japan, rises about two miles and a half above sea level; its crater is very deep. This volcano is not now active, but nearly two hundred years ago an eruption took place, sending a heavy shower of ashes far and wide over the country. The great cone was cracked and split. Many thousand people living in the region round the volcano were killed.</p>

<p>Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, the Philippines and many other islands southeast of Asia are commonly known as the <hi rend="italic">East Indies</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Malay Archipelago</hi>.</p>
<p>Lesson 80 describes the Philippines.</p>
<p>Thousands of years ago these islands were probably connected with Asia, if we may judge from the fact that the same kinds of large wild animals are found both on the mainland and on these border islands, but not beyond the deeper water which separates these islands from those nearer Australia. The seas around the East Indies are mostly shallow, and the very broken coast lines show that the land has in part settled beneath the sea.</p>
<p>In what direction is Java from Borneo (see map on page 187)? From Sumatra? From Australia? From the mainland of Asia?</p>
<p>Sumatra, Java and other smaller islands in line with them consist mainly of the upper parts of a long volcanic range. Many of the craters are very active. The lowlands that stretch from the highland to the coast are very

 


  


<pb n="168" id="txu-oclc-17540901-c-168" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />
fertile, and many of the short rivers are building deltas
in the border seas.</p>





<p>Banca and Billiton, two small islands east of Sumatra (see map on page 187), have very rich tin mines. Most of the tin is sent to the city of Singapore and thence to Europe. Large quantities of tin ore are found also in the Malay peninsula.</p>
<p>Borneo is one of the largest islands in the world. Its area is equal to
nearly one tenth that of the United States, exclusive of Alaska. This
great island consists mainly of a central plateau from which several
ranges branch into the lowland along the coast.</p>
<p>Among the Malay people of Borneo are many tribes of Dyaks. These are thought to be descendants of the earliest natives. The Dyaks build houses or huts of bamboo, as shown in the picture on this page. These natives weave cloth and make iron tools.</p>

<p>III. Climate</p>
<p>The three great peninsulas of southern Asia are almost wholly in the hot and warm belts. The cool belt reaches from the central highland region to the Arctic circle.</p>
<p>In summer, when the broad desert belt that extends across a large part of central Asia becomes intensely heated, the cool air of the trade winds bends northward towards and under the lighter heated air over the continent. The equatorial rain belt then spreads over all Asia south and southeast of the highland of Tibet and even gives heavy rainfall to a wide belt of eastern China, Korea and Japan. See <hi rend="italic">map of winds and rains of July, page 31.</hi></p>
<p>In winter, when the barren inland region of Asia is cold and the air above it heavy, the winds blow outward from the land to the sea, and the rainfall in all parts of the continent is then light.</p>

<p> The southern slopes of the Himalayas thus face the moist summer winds from over the Indian ocean and in that season have very heavy rainfall. This is also the rainy season in the basins of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and other streams farther east. Their dry season occurs during the northern winter, when the winds blow from the land to the sea.</p>
<p>To avoid the extreme summer heat of the lowlands, many Europeans living in northern India spend the hot season in the hills or low ranges along the southern border of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>Below the snow line of these mountains the southern slopes are covered with forests. Trees, vines, bushes and grasses form dense jungles near the foot of the
range, and in these are found tigers, elephants, rhinoceroses and other huge beasts.</p>
<p>The plains of the Ganges basin are carefully irrigated by means of canals leading from the river. The rainfall of the summer season is thus made to serve for the entire year, even through times of drouth. India is now a part of the British empire. Before the British nation took possession of India suffering from famine was common whenever the rains came late or in small quantities. There is not so much suffering now, because the English people have improved the canals
and have also built railroads which can quickly carry supplies to famine-stricken provinces.</p>
<p>During the wet season in the low Dekkan plateau the rain water is stored in large hollows or reservoirs; then when the dry season comes the water is led in ditches over the cultivated land.</p>
<p>The lower part of the Indus basin is a desert; the moist winds blowing inland over this low hot land retain their moisture till they reach the upper part of the river basin near the foot of the Himalayas. There they yield plentiful rains on the best wheat region of all India.</p>
<p>The winds of the Indian ocean that change direction and blow inland over southern Asia in summer and seaward in winter are called <hi rend="italic">monsoons</hi>, meaning <hi rend="italic">season winds</hi>. Soon after the winds change their direction they cause the ocean current under them to turn back and flow in the same direction with them.</p>

<p>The cold belt along the Arctic shore

regions, which, as a whole, are little better than deserts.</p>
<p>On the east of this highland the slopes of China and the Japan islands produce immense quantities of tea, rice and mulberry trees, the leaves of the latter being the food of silkworms.</p>
<p>On the south of the great highland the river valleys of the large peninsulas in the warm and the hot belts yield cotton, rice, sugar cane, wheat and almost countless tropical products of other kinds. Still farther south and southeast the island of Ceylon and the East Indies, or Malay Archipelago, supply a large portion of the tea, coffee, rice and spices used in the world.</p>
<p>On the west of the great Asian highland the small river valleys among the low plateaus produce dates, figs and other fruits, while the southern part of the Red sea coast is a famous coffee region.  Tell what you can about tea. <hi rend="italic">See page 46.</hi></p>

<p>Rice is a leading food crop in the delta lands and in the moist river valleys of the same great districts named for tea culture. To the people  of east and southeast Asia and the Malay Archipelago rice and other grain, called millet, are the staple articles of food for hundreds of millions of people. Some of the richest wheat lands in the world are in India.</p>
<p>The mulberry tree thrives in Japan, China, India and other warm or hot lands of east and southeast Asia, and a very important industry in these districts is thus made possible. The leaves are fed to silkworms that make silken cases, or cocoons, by spinning fine long threads and winding them about their bodies. Some of the cocoons contain more than two miles of silky fiber, and yet they are only about as large as a robin's egg. The cocoons are put into hot water to kill the silkworms; otherwise the worms would gnaw their way out, spoil the cocoons and fly away as moths. The fiber is unwound from the cocoon and is made into thread or cloth.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-169-1"></note></p>

<p><hi rend="bold">113. Animals of Northern Asia and Europe</hi></p>
<p>The animals of Europe and northern Asia, as well as the part of Africa north of the Sahara, do not differ very much from those of North America. In
fact, these regions together are often called the <hi rend="italic">Northern realm</hi> of animal life.</p>
<p>The grassy slopes of Europe and northern Asia, like those of the other parts of the temperate zone, feed great numbers of cattle, sheep, horses and hogs, and all these afford occupations for millions of people. Here are found also many domestic fowl.</p>
<p>In the colder plains of the north the tribes of yellow people keep large herds of reindeer. Many wild deer also visit the tundras in summer to feed on reindeer moss. As the winter comes on they go southward, where they can find leaves and tender branches.</p>
<p>The reindeer is to the people of the far north what cattle are to the people of our country, or what camels are to the people of great deserts, or what zebus are to the people of India.</p>
<p>The hoofs of the reindeer are very wide and are well suited for travel over
snow fields. This animal is very swift and can draw heavy loads. The milk and flesh of reindeer are used for food. Warm clothing is made from the skins. On the bleak northern plains of Eurasia many a man's wealth is counted in reindeer.</p>	
<p>In the summer the deer feed on shoots and leaves of shrubs and trees, but often in winter those that remain in the snowy plains must scrape through the snow to find reindeer moss.</p>

<p>Many elks, in the same great family as the moose of North America, live in the forests of the northern plains of Eurasia.</p>
<p>In the forests and cold plains of northern Eurasia are found countless fur-bearing animals, such as the beaver, otter, sable and ermine. The hunting of animals for furs is an important occupation of many of the yellow people and white settlers in this cold part of the earth.</p>
<p>In the mountains of southern Europe are found the graceful chamois and the ibex.</p>
 <p>The chamois and the ibex feed on high grassy slopes. They are very shy and often escape from hunters by leaping across wide chasms or down steep rocky slopes.</p>
<p>The useful yak is found in the great highland of central Asia.</p>
<p>The yak is of great service to the people of the highlands. It carries heavy burdens and supplies milk, meat and warm skins. Wild yaks sometimes live at a great height. They have been seen in the mountains nearly four miles above the level of the sea. <hi rend="italic">See picture on page 20</hi>.</p>
<p>The grassy portions of the desert plains near the northern side of the central highland of Asia are the home of the two-humped camel. To the people of this dry region this animal is as useful as the one-humped camel is to the people of northern Africa.</p>

</hi></p>
<p>India, Indo-China and the Malay Archipelago are sometimes called the <hi rend="italic">Oriental region</hi>. The word <hi rend="italic">Orient</hi> means <hi rend="italic">East</hi>.</p>
<p>Mountains rise as a barrier between the two animal regions in Asia; moreover, the climate north of the highland is much colder than that on the southern slope.</p>
<p>Another large ape, called the orang-outang, lives on the large islands southeast of Asia.</p>
<p>Apes of this species, as well as the gorilla of Africa, weave rude nests among branches and are rarely seen on the ground. Their food consists of fruits and leaves.</p>
<p>The most useful animals of the Orient are the zebu and buffalo. They are found in nearly all parts of southeast Asia and on the islands of this region; they have also spread westward into parts of Africa.</p>
<p>Zebus are a kind of cattle having great humps on their shoulders. Some of these animals are used for riding, and they can travel all day at the rate of five or six miles an hour. Zebus are also used for plowing, drawing carts
and doing other kinds of work.</p>
<p>The true buffalo of southeast Asia is often found in a wild state. Tame
buffaloes are useful as beasts of burden. These animals have very wide hoofs and are well suited to work on soft or marshy ground. Many buffaloes are
now used as draft animals in parts of southern Europe as well as Asia.</p>
<p>There are wild elephants in the jungles or forests of this region, and tame elephants in the villages.</p>
<p>Many of these huge beasts have been trained to work, but the cost of feeding them is so great that their places are, to a large extent, being taken by horses.
</p>
<p>The catlike tiger is a native of Asia. It is very strong, and as its food consists of small animals it is found in many parts of the continent.

<p>Review lessons 26, 27 and 28 and tell which part of Asia and the border islands are the home of the brown race; of the yellow race; of the white race.</p>
<p>The brown people of Java, Sumatra and parts of the other islands of the East Indies till the soil, raise herds of buffaloes and other domestic animals, manufacture cloth and metal goods, build cities and carry on commerce with foreign nations. Many of these people are very intelligent and well educated. In parts of the East Indies, however, especially remote from
the coast, the brown people are little better than savages.
For an account of the brown people of the Philippine islands, <hi rend="italic"> see lesson 80.</hi>
Sumatra, Java, south and east Borneo, Celebes, the western half of New Guinea and many of the smaller islands southeast of Asia belong to Holland, or the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The plateau of Tibet, the Middle Basin and Gobi regions, the Altai highland, parts of the plain of Siberia, the entire Pacific slope of Asia from Bering strait to the Malay peninsula, as well as the island of Japan, are the home of the yellow race in Asia. The principal countries of the yellow people are Japan, China, Anam and Siam.</p>
<p>The principal countries of the white race in Asia are the greater part of India, Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Persia, Arabia and Turkey. Many white people from Russia have moved eastward into Siberia and have built large cities along the old trade route which is now followed by the railroad.</p>
<p>In general we may say that the people living on the Arctic and Pacific slopes of Asia belong to the yellow race; that those living on the slopes that face the Indian ocean belong to the white race; that the people of the Malay Archipelago
belong to the brown race. It should be kept in mind, however, that people of various races have settled in parts of these regions.</p>

<p>In recent years the nations of Europe have tried to gain control of various parts of the Chinese empire, and some of them hold small portions of the country and claim the right to "exercise influence in trade" over still larger areas. It is impossible at present to foresee the result of this attempt to divide the great empire. What does lesson 27 tell about the Chinese?</p>
<p>JAPAN. Japan is the only limited monarchy in Asia, having its own ruler. All the other <hi rend="italic">independent</hi> countries are absolute monarchies.</p>
<p>The exports of Japan are taken from its rice swamps, its silkworm nurseries and its tea farms. The imports are mostly cloth, metal goods and petroleum. Japanese trade is carried on chiefly with the United States and with Great Britain.</p> 
<p>Japan is the most progressive of Asiatic countries. The Japanese

<p>What does lesson 17 tell about the surface of Africa?</p>
<p>Africa has a rounded outline broken by very few bays. The isthmus of Suez, through which the Suez canal has been dug, formerly made a land connection between Africa and Asia.</p>
<p> A wide canal about 100 miles long crosses the isthmus. This canal has no locks, as the land is mostly low and level. Before the Suez canal was made the water route from all ports in Europe to southwest Asia led round the cape of Good Hope. Steamers now going from western Europe to India save about 4000 miles by using the canal. Sailing vessels cannot pass through the canal without being towed at great expense; and, as a rule, they prefer the outside water route round southern Africa. Port Said is at the Mediterranean end of the Suez canal.</p>
 <p> Almost the entire continent of Africa is a plateau. The average height of this continent above sea level is double that of Europe. The highest mountains are in the east and south. The coastal plains of Africa are very narrow, because the border ranges of the highland lie near the sea. The highest plateau in Africa is that of Abyssinia. Its eastern slope, facing the Red sea, is steep and is not broken by large river valleys. The western slope is more gentle and is drained by several of the large branches of the river Nile.</p>
<p>The main river of the Nile system rises in the lake region of middle Africa and is the only large river flowing northward to the Mediterranean sea.  The basin of the Nile is thought to be about as large as that of the Mississippi.

<p>The Nile flows from Victoria lake, or <hi rend="italic">Nyanza</hi><note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-177-1"></note>.  This body of water is crossed by the equator and is about three fourths of a mile above sea level.</p>
<p>The Blue Nile and the Black Nile, or Atbara, are the main branches from the east. During the northern summer, when the equatorial rains reach the highland of Abyssinia, many torrents pour down these tributaries, filling the Nile with muddy water; but during the dry season the torrents dwindle away till only muddy pools or even dry channels remain.</p>
<p>For hundreds of miles this great river flows through the desert and does not receive a single has made after the equatorial rains have fallen in the highland of Abyssinia and in the lake region of middle Africa, the Nile overflows its flood plains and deposits a thin coating of rich soil.</p>
<p>This river has made a great delta on the shore of the Mediterranean sea.  When the Nile is flooded it pours into the sea nearly five times as much water as when the flood has gone down. </p> 
<p>The Nile contains rapids or cataracts which greatly hinder navigation. Large vessels ascend the river as far as the first cataract, near the tropic of Cancer. Several caravan routes across the desert lead to the river port of Assouan below this cataract. There the gums, oil, salt and ivory carried for hundreds of miles by camels can be placed on boats and floated down to the large cities in the delta plain. Small vessels can be hauled over the first cataract and can then sail up to the second.</p>
<p>In the lower part of the Nile valley are found the greatest monuments ever built by man. These are known as the Pyramids of Egypt and are the tombs of the ancient kings. One of these pyramids is 450 feet high, and the length of each side of the square base is nearly one seventh of a mile. The pyramids are made of huge blocks of stone.</p>

</p>
<p>What have you read about the great desert in northern Africa? <hi rend="italic">See lesson 17.</hi></p>
<p>The Sahara, though as large as the United States, supports only about one fortieth as many people. Most of these live near the fertile places, or oases, where there are wells or natural springs.
</p>
<p>A few low mountain ranges rise in the desert. Rain occasionally falls on these ranges, and small streams then flow into the desert lands. During the winter months some of the highest peaks in the desert are capped with snow.</p>
<p>In the middle and eastern parts of the desert the surface consists largely of stony flat-topped hills or table-lands. Some of these are a mile high. They are swept by hot, dry winds, which blow away the dust from their stony or gravelly surfaces.</p>
<p>The western part of the desert of Sahara is mainly a great sandy region in which countless dunes or sand hills form. Sonic of these are more than 600 feet high.</p>
<p>The Sahara is part of a great belt of arid regions that cross Arabia, part of Persia and extend to the Gobi desert. A wide branch of this barren belt spreads northward around the Aral and Caspian seas.
</p>
<p>We have studied about the great mountain barrier of the Himalayas. The Sahara also forms a barrier between northern and southern Africa, and very few of the plants and animals native to the lands north of the desert are found south of the great barren region, unless the white man has taken them there.
</p>
<p>Between the Sahara; the western part of the Mediterranean sea rise the Atlas mountains.</p>
<p>Small streams from the Atlas mountains flow into the border of the desert, and even after they dwindle away their ground water supplies many wells that have been sunk in that dry region. The water from these wells is used for irrigating groves of date palms. Thousands of wells have been sunk along the borders of the desert south of the Atlas range. In the next lesson we shall learn why the northern slopes of this range are more fertile.</p>
<p>What does lesson 17 tell about the Sudan?</p>
<p>The Sudan extends from the Atlantic coast to the highlands of Abyssinia. Eastern Sudan is in the Nile basin, western Sudan mostly in the Niger basin and central Sudan in the basin of lake Tchad.
</p>
<p>Southward from the Sahara the country changes gradually from a desert into grassy lands and finally into forest areas.</p>
<p>The main stream that feeds lake Tchad flows from the rainy forest country far in the southeast. Very little is known about the region in which this stream rises. Lake Tchad is in the largest basin of inland drainage in Africa; the lake is shallow and its banks are low. As the season changes from wet to dry, the lake varies greatly in size. At times it becomes larger than lake Superior and then shrinks to about one fourth its size, leaving thousands of square miles of swamps along its 
borders. When swollen by rains this lake overflows in a channel, or <hi rend="italic">wady</hi>, that leads into the desert. This overflow keeps the lake almost fresh.<lb />(<hi rend="italic">Continued on page 180.</hi>)

<p>The Niger basin is thought to be about three fourths as large as that of the Mississippi. It rises on the north side of the Kong mountains, makes a great bend northward, flows for several hundred miles in the Sahara desert, then turns southward and enters the sea through the largest delta in Africa.
</p>
<p>The greater part of this delta is covered with forests and coarse grass. Small steamers from the sea can go a few hundred miles up the Niger before their progress is stopped by rapids; but the steamers can ascend the Binue branch to a point about 600 miles from the sea. No other river in tropical Africa is navigable for so great a distance inland from the coast.
</p>
<p>The so-called <hi rend="italic">Kong mountains</hi> are chiefly the borders of a rugged plateau that rises in the form of terraces from the coast and extends far northward, in the basin of the Niger river.</p>
<p>The Kamerun mountains, near the head of the gulf of Guinea, consist of one large volcanic peak and many small ones.</p>
<p>The Kongo basin occupies the greater part of middle Africa and lies west and south west of the upper Nile basin. Almost all the Kongo basin is a plateau with a general slope westward. The average height of the region above sea level is about half a mile.</p>
<p>The Kongo, like the Nile, rises in the lake region of middle Africa. One branch of the Kongo forms the outlet of lake Tanganyika. Other branches flow from smaller lakes farther south.
</p>
<p>East of the lake region rise two volcanic peaks, Mts. Kenia and Kilimanjaro, the highest mountains in Africa, though they are not quite so high as Mt. McKinley.
</p>
<p>There are rapids and falls in the Kongo river at the place where it descends from the plateau to the narrow coastal plain. These falls prevent vessels from going far inland from the sea, but small steamers have been carried overland past the falls and now navigate the upper river, where they find an open waterway for thousands of miles along the great trunk stream and its branches.</p>
<p>South of the Kongo are the basins of the Zambezi and Orange rivers.
</p>
<p>In the Zambezi basin are found the same changes from forest to grass land and then to desert as in Sudan. The northern part of this basin has forests, but the southern part reaches the Kalahari desert. The Zambezi is the largest African river flowing into the Indian ocean. This stream is thought to drain an area equal to about two thirds that of the Mississippi basin.
</p>
<p>Locate the Victoria falls. These falls mark the place where the river leaves the great inland plateau. At the falls the Zambezi is a mile wide. The water plunges into a chasm about 400 feet deep and then flows through a narrow zigzag gorge.
</p>
<p>The Zambezi has built a large delta. Its mouths are generally barred with sand, but vessels that can float over the bars can ascend for about 300 miles.
</p>
<p>The main sources of the Orange river system are in the eastern coast ranges of southern Africa. Even the main river is too shallow for steamers, and many of the branches flow only during the wet season. There is good pasturage in the eastern part of the basin, but the middle and western parts are little better than a desert.
</p>
<p>Cape Colony is crossed from east to west by a rugged plateau that forms the southern end of the African highland. The principal range is known as the Snow mountains.
</p>
<p>Near the city of Cape Town rises a huge flat-topped rock called <hi rend="italic">Table mountain</hi>. Southward from this rocky mass extends a small peninsula ending in the well-known cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>Madagascar, the largest island off the coast of Africa, is about two and a half times as large as Great Britain. Its coastal region is mostly low and unhealthful, but the interior consists largely of grassy or wooded plateaus.</p>
<p>Among the small islands off the coast of Africa may be named <hi rend="italic">St. Helena</hi>, the rocky isle to which the British banished Napoleon after his defeat near Waterloo, a small town of Belgium; the Canary and Cape Verde islands, belonging to Spain; the Madeira islands and the Azores (the latter far to the northwest), belonging to Portugal.

<p><hi rend="bold">118. Climate</hi><lb />Africa is the hottest of the continents. Only the extreme southern part of this great land mass is in the cool belt.</p>
<p>The maps on page 31 show that with the changing seasons the belt of equatorial rains shifts from the southern border of the Sahara, across Sudan and the Kongo basin, to the northern border of the Kalahari desert. Middle Africa, therefore, is well supplied with rain.</p>
<p>The trade winds blow over the slopes facing the Indian ocean and give rainfall to the region as far inland as the mountain ranges, but very little to the interior of the continent.
</p>
<p>The desolate Sahara region is too far north to be reached by the equatorial rain belt; it is too far south to receive rains from the westerly winds.</p>
<p>The trade winds blow there nearly all the year round, coming mostly from the northeast. They cannot give out rain because they become warmer as they flow into the desert.</p>
<p>Violent winds, like squalls but without rain or clouds, often raise great quantities of dust in the Sahara, sometimes darkening the sky. These hot dust storms are called <hi rend="italic">simoons</hi>. While the stifling
heat and dust of a simoon prevail the camels in caravans often crouch to the ground and the men wrap their heads in their cloaks.
</p>
<p>The Kalahari desert also is beyond the equatorial rain belt, even when farthest south; it is also too far north to receive rainfall from the westerly winds.
</p>
<p>Near the equator the summer heat is not so strong as it is in the deserts of Kalahari and Sahara. In the equatorial region clouds shut out much of the sunshine, and even when the sun shines from
a cloudless sky the dense forests shelter the ground. The land and the air are also cooled by frequent rains.
</p>
<p>Intense summer heat is felt in these deserts, as there are neither trees nor grasses to shield the surface. During the day the dry sand or rock is quickly heated and in turn heats the air. During the night the bare surface and the cloudless air often become very cool.</p>
<p>The southern half of Africa is not so hot as the northern. In the south the continent is narrower and the interior is nearer, the sea.The inland regions are therefore sooner reached by sea winds, with clouds and occasional rains.</p>
<p>The upland in the eastern part of the Orange river basin receives rains from the westerly winds, but the lower middle and western parts of this basin have little rainfall.
</p>
<p>The seaward slopes of the Snow mountains of southern Africa, as well as those of the Atlas highlands in the extreme north, receive rainfall from the winds blowing from the sea, but their inland slopes are poorly supplied with water.</p>

In harvest time on the fertile delta and flood plains of the Nile may be seen cotton, sugar cane, rice, wheat, corn and other products like those raised on the Southern plains of the United States in nearly the same latitude. The grass lands of the Nile valley support many sheep and cattle. Date trees are very common, and the fruit is an important article of food. </p>
<p>The lands that slope from the Atlas mountains to the Mediterranean sea produce grains and fruits like those of southern Europe.</p>
<p>Grain and cotton are raised in parts of Sudan. Southern Sudan, like the Kongo basin, has large forest areas.</p>
<p>The vegetation of the valley of the Kongo is very luxuriant. Many kinds of palms abound, such as the oil palm, sago palm and cocoa palm.</p>
<p>Among the useful food plants are the cassava, yam, plantain and sugar cane. The oil palm and cotton are other important products.</p>
<p>The white people have established many trading stations along the coasts of tropical Africa and in the Kongo basin.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">120. Animal Life</hi><lb />The Sahara separates the home of the animals in middle Africa from the lands farther north.</p>
<p>Not far from the equator, on the west coast of Africa, are found many large and fierce apes. The largest and fiercest is the gorilla. Smaller apes and monkeys are found in all parts of the continent.
</p>
<p>The gorilla is not found in any other part of the earth. It feeds mostly on the fruit of banana plants and palm trees. For a nest it weaves vines into a rude hammock or mat among thick branches. The chimpanzee also is found in the same region.
</p>
<p>The vast desert tract of northern Africa, western and middle Asia is the home of the camel.
</p>
<p>The camel has a wide sole under the toes of each foot, to prevent it from sinking into the sand. The nostrils can be closed at will, and a veil of hair hangs over the eyes, to keep out the hot stinging sand that often blows over the desert.</p>
<p>The camel of Africa has a single hump on its back; that of central Asia has a doable hump. Before the animal starts on a long journey its master sees that the hump or humps are very large. These odd swellings, as we have learned, are masses of fat. When the beast has gone for a long time without food this fat nourishes the body.
</p>
<p>The camel can go without water for three or four days while bearing a heavy load across the heated desert. The body is supplied with water from pouches, or water cells, on the walls of the first stomach.</p>
<p>Camel's milk and flesh are used for food. The long hair that grows on the animal's hump, neck and legs is made into cloth.</p>
<p>One species of long-eared elephant lives in the parts of Africa where it can find branches and long grasses for food. Each year thousands of these giant beasts are killed for their ivory tusks.
</p>
<p>Among the other large and fierce animals of Africa are the lion, rhinoceros  and hippopotamus. There were once many giraffes, but most of them have been killed.
</p>
<p>In the grass lands in the southern half of this continent is found the Cape buffalo. The ostrich, that supplies valuable feathers, or <hi rend="italic">plumes</hi>, is reared in various parts of Africa.

Waht do lessons 24 and 28 tell about the people of Africa? Name some of the plants and animals that these people see.</p>
<p>The millions of black people that live in the part of Africa extending from the Sahara to the southern end of the continent belong to many different tribes that vary in intelligence, in language and in customs.</p>
<p>The Negroes in a large region stretching across the southern half of Sudan, especially in the basin of the Niger river and lake Tchad, are well advanced in many respects beyond the savage state. They carry on an extensive trade, not only with the white people that have built trading stations on the coast or on the bongo river, but also by caravans with the people of Egypt and other northern countries.

<p>The Sudanese, as the black natives of the Sudan are called, have built several very large towns that form the trade centers for the caravans. The ivory tusks of elephants form a lead
ing article of export. Camels and horses in large numbers are reared for market. Grain and cotton are also important products.
</p>
<p>The Kongo Negroes live mostly in small towns and villages. Many of the huts of these people are made of grass woven into mats and fastened to poles.These savages hunt in the great forest and fish in the deep streams. They sell ivory, palm oil and other products to the white traders that live in the coastal towns or that visit their inland homes.</p>
<p>The Negroes of southern Africa, chiefly in the basins of the Zambezi and Orange rivers, are known as <hi rend="italic">Kaffirs</hi>. Their color is dark brown. Some of them raise grain and have herds of cattle. The. Kaffirs include about three fourths of all the people in southern Africa; the others
are white people from Europe, mostly from the British Isles and Holland. Bands of small people called <hi rend="italic">Bushmen</hi> live in and round the Kalahari desert. They have no gardens but live by hunting the antelopes that feed on tufts of grass growing in this region. These small savages belong to the Negro race. <hi rend="italic">See Kaffir huts on page 181.</hi></p>
<p>Most of the people north of the Sahara, as well as in the desert itself, belong to the Semitic or dark branch of the white race. </p>
<p>The desert tribes consist mostly of wandering Arabs, or <hi rend="italic">Bedouins</hi>. Their original home was Arabia, hence the name <hi rend="italic">Arabs</hi>.</p>
<p>The upper basin of the Nile, in middle Africa, forms part of the great region peopled by Negroes. The lower basin of the Nile, including the region of the rich flood plains and the delta, is one of the most thickly settled parts of the world. Most of the people belong to the white race, though their skin is very dark. They are known as <hi rend="italic">Egyptians</hi>; among them live many Arabs.
</p>
<p>Other swarthy or dark-skinned people of the Semitic braanch of the white race live in the countries along the southern shore of the Mediterranean sea. <hi rend="italic">See pictures of the Egyptian and the Bedouin on this page; the Algerian, page 184.</hi></p>

EGYPT. This country is nominally part of the Ottoman empire, though the sultan of Turkey has very little control over the affairs of Egypt. The <hi rend="italic">khedive</hi>, or ruler, of Egypt resides in <hi rend="bold">Cairo</hi>, the capital. This is one of the oldest cities in the world.</p>
<p>The principal exports of Egypt are cotton and cotton seed. The most valuable imports here, as in all other African countries, are various kinds of cloth.	Great Britain controls the greater part of the foreign trade of Egypt.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Alexandria</hi>, in the Nile delta, is the largest seaport of this country.</p>
<p>Before the discovery of the route from Europe to India by way of the cape of Good Hope, Alexandria was one of the greatest ports in the world. When the East India trade with western Europe was turned away from the Mediterranean sea the port in the Nile delta rapidly declined. The building of the Suez canal has greatly increased the trade of Alexandria.

<p>TUNIS AND ALGERIA. These countries have been added to the possessions of France: They form part of the French territory which extends across the Sahara and the Sudan.</p>
<p>The coastal districts of Tunis and Algeria have many fertile valleys that produce wheat.
Olives grow here in abundance, and cattle and sheep find good grazing land. The cities of <hi rend="bold">Tunis</hi> and <hi rend="bold">Algiers</hi> export wheat, olive oil, wool and hides to France.</p>
<p>MOROCCO. The products of this country are similar to those of Algeria. <hi rend="bold">Fez</hi> and Morocco are the principal cities of Morocco.</p>
<p>SIERRA LEONE. This small colony belongs to the British nation. <hi rend="bold">Freetown</hi> exports palm oil.</p>
<p>LIBERIA. This is a Negro republic settled largely by freed slaves from the United States. <hi rend="bold">Monrovia</hi>, the capital, is named after a former President of our country. The chief exports from Monrovia are coffee and palm oil.

<div type="section"><head>AUSTRALIA </head><p> <hi rend="bold">123. Surface and Climate</hi> <lb /> Australia, the smallest of the continents, is about equal in area to the United States, not including Alaska. The Australian Alps and the Blue mountains,
<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-185-1" n="1"></note>
near the southeast coast, are the highest ranges and are about equal in height to the southern part of the Appalachian highland. Except in the southeast, the scattering ranges are little more than high hills, most of which rise above a half circle of low plateaus spreading inland from all coasts except the south. </p>
<p>This continent is famous for its gold mines. They are mostly in the hills and mountains that rise a little back from the eastern shore. There are rich tin mines in the same region.</p>
<p>The largest river basin of the continent is that of the Murray river. It is thought to be a little more than one third as large as the Mississippi basin.</p>
<p>The Murray river and branches form the only large river system in Australia, and yet even the main stream of this system is not deep enough to float large sea-going vessels can ascend the Murray
and some of it branches; but in seasons of drouth the rivers become too shallow for shipping, and some of them are little more than chains of ponds or shallow pools. In what season does the equatorial rain belt reach the northern part of Australia? <hi rend="italic">See maps on page 31</hi>. In what season do the winds blow from Australia towards the sea? In what season do they blow inland from the sea? Compare the maps on page 31 and tell what you can about the winds of Australia.
</p>
<p>When the equatorial rains reach the northern part of the pampas and the valley of the Kongo they also fall on the portion of Australia north of the tropic of Cancer; at the same time winds from the sea blow inland over the eastern slopes of the Australian Alps and the Blue mountains, giving plentiful rains to the whole Pacific slope. During the southern winter the winds blow seaward and therefore yield little rain.
</p>
<p>The winds that enter Australia from the ocean on the south seldom give out rain, because they are becoming warmer as they move towards the equator. The summer trade winds that give rainfalls to the Pacific slope of the eastern ranges pass as dry winds over the interior. The equatorial rains do not reach far into the interior. A vast area in middle and southern Australia is therefore very dry, and parts are great deserts. The rivers of the Murray system and other streams farther north and fed 
chiefly by the rains in the highland of the east and southeast. Inland Austhalia has a number of large lakes with no outlet to the sea.</p>

They have settled chiefly in the three eastern states of the mainland, and the Tasmania on the island of the same name. The states occupying the middle and western parts of the continent are very thinly settled. In Australia, there are about one twentieth as many people as in our own country.
</p>
<p>Australia is one part of the British empire and is a union of states under the name of Commonwealth of Australia. The Governor-General of Australia iss appointed by the British crown, but the country has its own law-making body.

<p><hi rend="bold">127. Cities of Australia</hi><lb />The states in the southeastern part of this continentt are the most thriving. Here are vast grazing districts that support millions of sheep and cattle. Large areas are planted with wheat, Indian corn and other cereals, Great quantities of gold and tin are mined. Middle and. western Australia are thinly settled.
</p>
<p>The principal exports from Australia are wool, gold and cereals. The most valuable imports are cloth and iron manufactures. The largest seaports are in southeast Australia, in the most productive states.
</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Melbourne</hi>, the chief seaport of Victoria, and <hi rend="bold">Sydney</hi>, the principal port of New South Wales, are the largest cities of Australia. The population of each is almost as large as that of Boston. Melbourne has extensive manufactures. Sydney is on a long and deep landlocked bay. This is the oldest city in Australia.

<p><hi rend="bold">128. New Zealand and Other Islands</hi><lb />NEW ZEALAND. A little more than a thousand miles southeast of Australia lie two large islands and several small ones, forming the group known as <hi rend="italic">New Zealand</hi>, belonging to the British empire. The western part of the larger islands has ranges rivaling in height the Rocky mountains. The principal lowlands are on the east of these ranges.
</p>
<p>New Zealand receives heavy rainfall from the westerly winds. Great glaciers creep down the lofty gorges on many of the higher peaks.</p>
<p>New Zealand is about as far south of the equator as the states of California and Oregon are north of that line, and the two regions extend through about the same number of degrees of latitude. Their climates are in many respects similar.
</p>
<p>Many parts of New Zealand are covered with forests. Among the trees are lofty pines and large tree ferns. Grains thrive there, but the chief industry is sheep raising. Some gold is found in the mountains.</p>
<p>The aborigines of New Zealand are known as <hi rend="italic">Maoris</hi>; they belong to the brown race. The number of Maoris is small compared with that of the white people who in recent years have chosen these islands for their home.</p>
<p>The most valuable exports from New Zealand are wool, gold and frozen meat. <hi rend="bold">Dunedin</hi> is the chief port of the South island; <hi rend="bold">Auckland</hi>, of the North island. <hi rend="bold">Wellington</hi> is the capital.
</p>
<p>NEW GUINEA. The island of New Guinea, north of Australia, is about three and a half times as large as Great Britain. The British, German and Dutch nations clam this island, but except along some parts of the coast where white people have made small settlements, New Guinea is in possession of black people who do very little to develop its resources, though the lowlands of the islands are fertile.</p>
<p>CORAL AND VOLCANIC ISLANDS. Many of the low islands in the Pacific are of coral origin. Some are in the form of long bars, or <hi rend="italic">reefs</hi>; others take the shape of rings, or <hi rend="italic">atolls</hi>, inclosing lagoons.</p>
<p>The higher islands far out in the Pacific are volcanoes. Many of these are still active, but others are extinct. Coral reefs, called <hi rend="italic">barrier reefs</hi>, surround most of the lofty islands.</p>
<p>Cocoanuts, breadfruit, fish and turtles are almost the only food of the natives on most of the small Pacific islands. </p>
<p>Cocoanut trees What does lesson 81 tell about the Samoa islands? The Ladrone islands? Locate the Fiji islands. <hi rend="italic">See map on page 187</hi>.</p>
<p>There are about 300 islands in the Fiji group, the most important being Viti-Levu. These islands are chiefly of volcanic origin. 'They are rugged and mountainous. Before white men settled on some of these islands the Fijians were cannibals, as were also many other groups of Pacific or "South Sea" islanders. The custom of eating human flesh has not wholly disappeared from all the islands.</p>
<p>Southeast of the Fiji group are the Tonga islands, of which Tonga is the largest. Many of the natives of these islands have been taught by white people to read.
</p>
<p>Northeast of New Guinea are several groups of islands which together take the name of <hi rend="italic">Micronesia</hi>, meaning <hi rend="italic">small islands</hi>. Among these groups the Ladrones are mostly of volcanic origin; but the Carolinas, Marshall and Gilbert islands are chiefly the work of coral polyps.
</p>
<p>The savages who dwell in Micronesia may be grouped with the people of the brown race; but in language and customs the Micronesians differ from the natives of the large islands of the East Indies.
</p>
<p>The natives of the Marshall islands are very skillful in sailing canoes. These islanders often take voyages They carry provisions, but depend on rain for drink. Perhaps the lonely islands far out in the Pacific were in many instances first peopled by castaways who, while out in their boats, were driven far from their currents.</p>

As the earth rotates from west to east, Boston is turned into the sunlight about an hour earlier eachh morning than Chicago. After sunrise in Chicago, darkness continues for more than two hours in San Francisco. Can you tell why?
</p>
<p>How many degrees are there in a circle? In how many hours does the earth rotate 360&deg;? How many degrees does the earth rotate in one hour? The United States, exclusive of Alaska, extends from the 67th meridian almost to the 125th. About how many hours elapse each day while the midday sun is over some part of our country?
</p>
<p>When it is midday along the 75th meridian, what time is it along the 90th? Along the 105th? Along the 120th? How far apart are these meridians? Which is nearest New York? Which is nearest Chicago? Which is nearest San Francisco?</p>
<p>If all clocks were set by the midday sun, calling midday twelve o'clock, the time would differ in cities east or west of one another. A watch, though correct in one of these places, would be wrong in all others. A traveler could not then rely on his watch for exact railroad time.</p>
<p>In order to secure uniform time over large districts, railroad companies have divided the country into four belts, each of which takes its time from a certain meridian. Timepieces in the Eastern belt are set by the true or mean solar time on the 75th meridian. All timepieces therefore in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Richmond and all other places in this belt are regulated to agree.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-c-192-1" n="1"></note>
</p>
<p>In like manner, all places in the Central belt, the Mountain belt and the Pacific belt take their time from the meridians of 90&deg;,105&deg; and 120&deg; respectively. As these meridians are 15&deg; apart, the time in each belt differs exactly one hour from the time in the belt on either side.</p>
<p>The time in general use over a belt is called standard time or railroad time.</p>
<p>In going from one time belt into another, travelers set their watches forward or back one hour. Traveling eastward, which way should the hands of a watch be moved when another time belt is reached?</p>
<p>The borders of the time belts are made irregular to favor railroad companies that wish to use uniform time over very large areas.</p>
<p>Which of these belts is the widest? How many hours difference in time is there between Boston and San Francisco?</p>
<p>International Date Line. The common day, often called the civil day, lasts from midnight to midnight,&mdash;twenty-four hours. In order that the civil day may have the same number or date the world around, the leading nations have agreed to use the date of the days as they begin on the 180th meridian. See map on page 190.</p>
<p>For example, the fourth day of July begins on the 180th meridian at midnight following the third of July. At that time it is midday of the third of July in Greenwich; and six o'clock in the morning of the same day in New Orleans, 90&deg; W. Then as the earth rotates towards the east, both London and New Orleans are turned into darkness, the one six hours ahead of the other. As soon as it is midnight in London, that city begins to count the new date of July 4th; six hours later New Orleans has its midnight and then its fourth of July begins.
</p>
<p>Thus it is with every city,&mdash;its dates are counted from midnight to midnight, and each day takes the same date as that given to the latest new day on the 180th meridian. We may think of the new date as traveling westward with the midnight. This date is given to each place as soon as the midnight reaches it. When midnight again occurs on the 180th meridian, another date begins its journey round the earth.
</p>
<p>When vessels cross the 180th meridian, they either drop a day or add one to the calendar. As the new date begins on that line, a vessel sailing eastward across the line goes out of the area having the new date and must therefore go hack a day. Sailing westward, the vessel enters the area having a new day and must therefore add a day to the calendar. Thus when sailing eastward across the line, Monday is dropped for Sunday; but sailing westward over the line, Saturday at once gives place to Sunday.</p>
<p>The meridian of 180&deg;, at which all new civil days of commercial nations begin, is called the "International date line."</p>
<p>People living on many islands near the meridian of 180&deg; make the dates of their calendars agree with those of the nearest country with which they have commercial relations. The dotted lines branching from the meridian of 180&deg; on the large Commercial Map of the World (page 190) show how the islands regulate their dates.</p>

The relief maps on this page and on the two following pages are intended as guides for drawing and modeling the continents. These maps are purposely made very simple, yet they show the natural features which exert the greatest influence upon the distribution of climates, plants and animals.</p>
<p>Pupils should learn to sketch these maps from memory, without the aid of straight guide-lines, except such as they themselves invent.
</p>
<p>The Teachers' Manual offers suggestions upon methods of drawing and modeling the continents.

<p><hi rend="bold">1. Area and Surface of Texas</hi></p>

<p>Texas is the largest state in the Union. It is nearly six times as large as Pennsylvania. France and England together are not equal in area to Texas.</p>

<p>The area of Texas is 265,750 square miles.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-004-a" place="upper left of the page"><figDesc>A Texas cotton field</figDesc></figure>

<p>We may divide the surface of Texas roughly into four parts,&mdash;the Gulf slope, the Central basin, the Staked plains and other plateaus, the mountain region west of the Pecos river.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Gulf Slope</hi>. A low, flat plain skirts the Gulf. Most of it is treeless. It is made of sand, clay and silt. This is one of the newest plains on the earth. It was formed under the waters of the Gulf, as is shown by the shells in it. They are like those now found in the Gulf.</p>

<p>Many rivers from farther inland cross this coastal plain. They have worn their beds only a few feet below the general level. Between the rivers are many swamps or poorly drained areas. The water from the swamps has not yet cut outlets deep enough to drain the land. This also shows that the plain is young.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-004-b" place="lower left of the page"><figDesc>Diagram illustrating arrangement of strata in the Gulf slope (after R. T. Hill). The layers incline from northwest to southeast</figDesc></figure>

<p>On the Sabine river this coastal plain is about thirty miles wide, but it widens to the westward. On the Colorado river it reaches about one hundred miles inland from the Gulf. Still farther west it merges with the Rio Grande plain.</p>

<p>The Rio Grande plain is part of the Gulf slope. It reaches from the Gulf to the bluffs along the plateau border (Balcones scarp). As a whole it is fairly level. </p>

<p>Along the inland border of the young coastal plain in eastern Texas a rolling country begins. Farther inland the rivers have worn deep valleys, leaving many parts of the region in the form of flat-topped hills. These are capped with beds of sandstone or of iron ore. The tops of some are small plateaus. These are parts of the surface of a former plain which the rivers are cutting away. This region has many forests and takes the name of Forested area. It reaches westward a little beyond the Colorado river, where it merges into the drier Rio Grande plain.</p>

<p>Between the Forested area and the Central basin lie the prairies. The eastern part is called the Black prairie; the western part is the Grand prairie. As a whole the prairies are gently rolling or wavy lands. The soil is deep and very fertile.</p>


<p>Many of the prairie streams are fringed with trees, and clumps of live oaks are seen here and there over the surface.</p>

<p>The largest rivers crossing the prairies flow from the Staked plains and Central basin. The flood plains or bottoms along the prairie rivers have very rich soil. The prairies extend from the Colorado river at Austin north and northeast to the Red river. They form one of the best agricultural regions of the world. Within this area are Waco, Fort Worth, Dallas, Sherman and Paris.</p>

<p>The line between the Black and the Grand prairies follows the general direction of the Eastern Cross Timbers. The Western Cross Timbers lie along the western margin of the Grand prairie.</p>

<p>The eastern margin of the Black prairie is in places about 400 feet above sea level. The prairies rise gradually towards the west and reach an altitude of about 1000 feet.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Central Basin</hi>. Between the prairies and the plateaus of the west lies the Central basin. A line of bluffs or

scarps facing inland divides the basin from the prairies. The rivers from the basin flow in valleys cut through these bluffs.</p>

<p>It seems odd to see rivers flowing towards and through bluffs. At first we wonder how the rivers cut their valleys. But the study of the rocks on the floor of the basin shows them to be older than the rocks of the prairies. The basin rocks have been deeply worn and the surface we now see there was once deeply buried. The streams of this old land flowed to the sea where the prairies now lie.</p>

<p>As the prairies rose slowly from the sea, the basin rivers kept cutting their channels deeper across the new land. The rivers simply flowed down the slope to the sea, just as they are crossing the new coastal plain to-day.</p>

<p>The bluffs along the west and southwest border of the Grand prairie are very ragged. Streams have cut so many valleys in this region that it is in places very hilly.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-005-a" place="upper middle of the page"><figDesc>RELIEF MAP OF TEXAS</figDesc></figure>

<p>The Floor of the Central basin is made of various kinds of rock. Some are soft and some are hard. As the surface has worn away, the harder rocks have been left as hills. Some parts of the basin are very hilly. In other places the soft rock has worn down more evenly, making rolling prairie lands. The hardest rocks are in the south, and there the most hilly lands are found. The central and northern parts are more level. On the western side of the Central basin the bluffs are worn into benches, some of which extend eastward like long tongues.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-005-b" place="lower left of the page"><figDesc>Forest of long-leaf or yellow pine</figDesc></figure>

<p><hi rend="italic">Plateaus</hi>. The plateau region of Texas is the southern part of the Western plain lying along the base of the Rocky mountains.</p>

<p>The Rio Pecos in Texas has cut a valley which divides the Stockton plateau on the west from the Edwards plateau on the east. Farther north lie the Staked plains.</p>

<p>The eastern border of the Staked plains and the Edwards plateau is a ragged bluff or scarp facing eastward. It is from 150 to 300 feet high and overlooks the Central basin. The bluffs are deeply cut by many streams flowing into the basin. Here are found head waters of the Red, Brazos and Colorado rivers.</p>
 

<p>In the southeast the plateau region is about 1000 feet above sea level. It rises gently northward, and reaches over 4000 feet in the Panhandle.</p>


<p>Most of the surface of the Staked plains was once the bed of a lake. The land is very level. It needs only water to make it fertile. The region of plateaus farther south was formed in the sea.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Mountain region</hi>. There are various short ranges of mountains in this region. Among these are the Guadalupe, Sierra Diablo and Davis ranges. The highest peak in the state is Guadalupe, &mdash; 9500 feet. On the south and west this peak has an almost vertical face several thousand feet high.</p>

<p>Between the ranges of this region are numerous basins or flats. They are high plains, but are unlike most plateaus in being made of rock waste washed from the sides of the ranges. Near the mountains the waste is coarse; the finer material is carried farther out into the basins, This is true of many other inland basins.</p>

<pb n="6" id="txu-oclc-17540901-e-006" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />

<p>This is a region of contrasts. From the sandy plains rise mountains, some as single peaks, others in groups. Some of the summits are sharply outlined against the sky; others are great rounded domes. Here and there fiat-topped mesas appear, with steep sides and deep ravines.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Rivers</hi>. Most of the rivers of Texas flow southeast. The largest are the Brazos and Colorado. They rise in  the Staked plains. Farther east are the Trinity and Sabine. The Nueces crosses the Rio Grande plain. In the west the Rio Pecos enters the Rio Grande, and this great river flows along the southern boundary of Texas to the Gulf.</p>


<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-006-a" place="upper left of the page"><figDesc>View towards the foothills of Quitman mountains</figDesc></figure>

<p>The rivers of this state are not navigable for any great distance from the Gulf. It is thought that some rivers, like the Trinity, can be made navigable by means of locks and dams.</p>

<p>From the New Mexico border to the mouth of the Pecos the Rio Grande is often dry in summer. In the spring it is greatly swollen. At El Paso, 1030 miles from its mouth, the Rio Grande is 3700 feet above sea level. At the place where the Pecos enters, it is only 1000 feet.</p>

<p>There are five distinct types of rivers in Texas.</p>

<p>1. The little streams that have made shallow channels in the young coastal plain. They have not yet had time to cut outlets deep enough to drain the swamps. As years pass they will cut deeper and gradually drain the land better.</p>

<p>2. The rivers rising in the older parts of the Gulf slope. They have had time to wear deep valleys. Their many branches have cut the slope in places into hilly land. Along their banks they have made fertile bottoms.</p>

<p>3. The rivers of the Central basin. These have reached out far and wide, as the land has been worn down. They have also sent the trunk rivers across the Gulf slope, holding their courses as the land slowly rose. These are the upper portions of the Bed, Trinity, Brazos and Colorado rivers, &mdash; the oldest in the state.</p>

<p>4. The rivers of the plateaus. Among these are the headwaters of the Guadalupe and Nueces. They are not so important as the rivers named above.</p>

<p>5. The rivers rising in the Rocky mountains. To this class belong the Canadian, Pecos and Rio Grande.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Lakes</hi>. The lakes of Texas are small. Most of them occur in the Coastal plain. One of these is lake Caddo, on the eastern boundary of Texas.</p>

 
<p>There are several salt lakes in the Coastal plain near the mouth of the Rio Grande. In Salt basin, between the Guadalupe mountains and the Sierra Diablo, there are many salt lakes. The rainfall is not heavy enough to cause them to overflow their valleys. There are also small bodies of water on the Staked plains. Some of these dry up at times, others remain through the year.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Water Power</hi>. West of the Colorado river many streams have their sources in large springs and afford excellent water power. The larger rivers, as the Colorado and Prazos, are also utilized at many points.</p>

<p>On the Guadalupe river, between Cuero and Ingram, there are not less than fifteen plants where water furnishes power for pumping, milling, etc. On the San Marcus there are almost as many more. The latter stream rises in a great spring over which the water is now backed by a dam a quarter of a mile below.</p>

<p>At Marble halls, on the Colorado, the river is checked by a natural dam of limestone, making a fall of twenty-two feet. Below this the river descends swiftly in a deep canyon, where great power can be developed. Only a small part of the power in the rivers of Texas is now being used.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Irrigation</hi>. The water in many streams is held back by dams and is led in ditches or canals over the land. The waters of the Pecos are thus used at molly points, as are also the waters of the Concho, a branch of the Colorado. San Felipe creek, near Del Rio, and the San Saba, at Menardville, furnish both irrigating water and power. These are examples of what has been done to make semi-arid lands productive.</p>

<p>Since the planting of great rice fields in the Coastal plain, powerful steam pumps have been used to pump water from rivers, small lakes and wells. One pumping station will furnish water for many acres.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-006-b" place="lower right of the page"><figDesc>Marble falls on the Colorado river; a natural dam</figDesc></figure>

<p><hi rend="italic">Artesian Water</hi>. In many places where water cannot be obtained by digging ordinary wells, it is obtained by boring or drilling. In some cases it spouts from the hole and rises high into the air; in other cases it rises in the hole but does not reach the surface. It can then be


<pb n="7" id="txu-oclc-17540901-e-007" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />

 
pumped. Water that flows or is pumped from wells drilled or bored is called artesian water.</p>

<p>The source of such water is far away from the wells. It has crept down the slopes through sandy or rocky layers. In arid or semi-arid lands the artesian wells are of greatest value, as they supply water for drinking and for irrigation.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-007-a" place="upper left of the page"><figDesc>TEXAS Showing Mean Annual Rainfall</figDesc></figure>

<p>The portions of the state in which artesian water may be obtained are shown on the map. The area is almost wholly within the Gulf slope. Of the water-bearing beds, those known as the Trinity sands are the best.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Springs</hi>. There are many common springs issuing from beneath bluffs or welling up near the banks of water courses. There are also great artesian springs that rise from a line of cracks or fissures where layers of rock have cracked and slipped up or down. This line of fissures passes Austin, Manchaca, San Marcos, San Antonio, Brackett, Del Rio and other places, all of which have fine springs.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">2. Climate</hi></p>
<p>All eastern Texas has plenty of rainfall. It comes mostly from the Gulf. The extreme east has from fifty to sixty inches a year. The Black prairie and most of the Grand prairie have about ten inches less. Next on the west lies a belt that includes the southwest portion of the Grand prairie, the eastern part of the Central plain and a strip reaching southward to the mouth of the Rio Grande, in which the rainfall is from thirty to forty inches. West of this belt the fall of rain grows less and less, and only about ten inches fall on the Staked plains.</p>

<p>Regions having less than twenty inches of rainfall need to be irrigated.</p>
<p>The mouth of the Rio Grande is less than two and a half degrees from the torrid zone. The most northerly boundary of Texas is about 725 miles farther north. This shows that the temperature must vary greatly. There is also difference in heat owing to the elevation of the western part of the state.</p>

<p>Near the Gulf coast the temperature is quite even. It is hot or warm most of the year. There are short cool spells called "northers." Snow is rare. But farther inland there are wider changes in temperature.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">3. Soil and Plants</hi></p>
<p>There are two kinds of soil, namely, that formed by the decay of underlying rocks in place, and that brought by water, ice, wind or other means.</p>

<p>The rivers and smaller streams of Texas have carried much soil. It has been laid down on the flood plains or bottoms. In many places it is deep, and nearly all of it is very fertile. The bottom lands along the Brazos are among the richest lands in the world. Other rich bottoms are found along the Red, Trinity, Colorado, Guadalupe and Nueces rivers.</p>

<p>The Coastal plain consists chiefly of sands and clays. These were carried by rivers into the Gulf and settled over the area that later rose to form the plain. Some of the clays form black waxy soil. The soils of this young Coastal plain are excellent for rice growing, market gardening and fruit culture.</p>


<p>The rice belt extends from the Sabine river to the Rio Grande, but while a large part of this belt is suited to the growth of rice, the chief districts are a circle with a radius of about forty or fifty miles round Beaumont, and the Colorado valley section from Columbus to the Gulf. The rice lands are spreading inland, as pumps can be used to supply water to the lands.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-007-b" place="bottom right of the page"><figDesc>TEXAS Showing the Rice belt and East Texas Fruit Region</figDesc></figure>


<p>The soils of eastern Texas are excellent for raising fruits and vegetables. Peaches, pears, apples, melons, strawberries and other fruits, as well as many kinds of

 

<pb n="8" id="txu-oclc-17540901-e-008" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />

vegetables, are shipped in great quantities. This industry is growing rapidly.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-008-a" place="upper left of the page"><figDesc>TEXAS Showing the wooded Areas</figDesc></figure>

<p>The Rio Grande plain is too dry for cultivation, but it supports a growth of grass that well adapts it to stock raising.</p>

<p>The prairie lands have long been noted for their fine grass. They also yield large crops of cotton, corn and wheat, far more valuable than the grass. Most of the soil of the prairies is the black waxy soil.</p>


<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-008-b" place="left middle of the page"><figDesc>Cotton mills, Dallas</figDesc></figure>

<p>Texas is the leading cotton state of the Union. The best cotton lands are in the prairies and all East Texas, except the poorly drained Coastal plain.</p>

<p>In addition to the fiber, which is made into cloth and batting, the seeds of the cotton plant yield valuable oil. The hulls and the ground cake or meal are fed to stock.</p>

<p>Cotton-seed oil mills are found in nearly every large town in the state. Much of the oil is shipped abroad, to be returned to us as "olive oil." Cottonseed oil is also largely used in making lard compounds.</p>

<p>One of the largest cotton-seed oil mills in the world is in Sherman.</p>

<p>The bottoms of the lower Brazos are among the best sugar-cane lands known.</p>


<p>A large part of East Texas is within the Forested area. The forests include the valuable long-leaf pine, as well as other pines, and also various hard-wood trees, such as oak and hickory. Cypress grows along the streams. The soil of the pine region is not very fertile. The red soils of the uplands are rich and well suited for fruit growing.</p>

<p>We have already learned where the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers are.</p>

<p>There are many sawmills in East Texas. They are scattered throughout the pineries. Their output, chiefly of long-leaf pine, is enormous.</p>

<p>The soil of the Staked plains is material that settled on the bed of the lake which long ages ago stood where the dry plains now are. With plenty of water these lake plains would be very fertile, but lack of rain is felt in this region. The lands are mostly given to pasturage.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">4. Animals</hi></p>
<p>Texas raises more cattle than any other state of the Union. The best grazing lands are the prairies, but immense herds of cattle feed also in the forested area, the Central basin, the plateaus and pert of the Rio Grande plain. In the drier parts of the state, stock raising is the chief industry.</p>

<p>Many sheep graze on the ranges in the southwestern part of the state. Texas has large numbers of horses, mules and hogs.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">5. Minerals</hi></p>
<p>The little map shows that there are two principal coal fields in Texas. One is the Brazos coal field; it lies north of the Colorado river. The other is south of the river and is known as the Colorado coal field. The latter is not yet developed. There are large collieries in the Brazos field at Thurber. At many points in the state, between Texarkana and Laredo, on the Rio Grande, there are found beds of impure coal called <hi rend="italic">lignite</hi>. In some places they furnish a valuable fuel.</p>

<p>The most productive oil field in Texas is in a small area known as "Spindle-top Heights," near Beaumont. The oil was first struck here in the first month of this century. The yield of oil is enormous. Great storage tanks have been made, and pipe lines carry oil to Port Arthur. There is a refinery at Port Arthur.</p>

<p>The Corsicana and Sour Lake fields are next in importance. Oil in Corsicana field was found about ten years ago, while drilling for water. Corsicana and Powell have refineries. Smaller quantities of oil have been found in other parts of the state.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-009-b" place="middle of the page"><figDesc>Salt making at Colorado</figDesc></figure>

<p>Iron ore occurs over a large part of northeast Texas. Beds of iron ore often form the capstones of the flattopped hills of the Forested area. There are valuable beds of iron ore in the counties of Llano and Mason.</p>

<p>The lively metal called quicksilver comes from a mineral known as cinnabar. The metal may be seen oozing from the ore when heated. Cinnabar is found in Brewster county, and furnaces have been built at Terlingua for extracting the metal from the ore.</p>

<p>Salt is found in salt lakes and seeps, as well as in the form of rock salt. At times the water in lagoons along the lower coast dries up and leaves a coating of salt. Rock salt has been found by boring at Colorado City, and at Grand Saline, where salt works have been erected, and in other places. Asphaltum, sulphur, gold, silver, lead and copper have been found in some parts of Texas.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">6. People and Occupations</hi></p>
<p>In 1821 Mexico threw off the yoke of Spain and became a republic. Texas was then a part of Mexico. At that time most of the settlers in Texas were Americans, but there were also many people of Spanish descent, chiefly settlers from other parts of Mexico.</p>

<p>In 1836 Texas won its freedom from Mexico and for nine years was a republic. It was often called the Lone Star Republic. In 1845 it became one of the United States.</p>

<p>Most of the people of Texas are descendants of settlers from other states of the Union. There are also some Mexicans in parts of the state, but chiefly in the cities and towns nearest the Mexican border.</p>

<p>The population of Texas in 1900 was 3,048,710. In the ten years before 1900 it gained over 80,000 a year. Taking the same rate of increase, you can easily estimate the present number of people in the state.</p>

<p>Most of the people of the state are engaged in farming and stock raising. Many are at work preparing agricultural products for market. Others are getting out lumber. Still others work in the oil fields, and in the coal mines.</p>

<p>Railroads form a network over the state and employ many persons in their management. Many thousands work in the stores which supply food, clothing, tools and many other articles to the people.</p>

<p>The people of Texas are energetic and progressive. Their cities are well built. Most of them have excellent schools, good water systems, electric lights, fine roads and beautiful buildings. Many of the cities are growing rapidly.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">9. The Public Schools</hi></p>
<p>The public schools of Texas have in recent years made great progress, due largely to the influence of the Sam Houston Normal Institute and the University of Texas, in furnishing trained and competent teachers. All the cities and larger towns have graded schools, and there are now within the state about fourscore public high schools affiliated with the University. These schools

<pb n="13" id="txu-oclc-17540901-e-013" rend="Arabic" place="upper right" />

fulfill the entrance requirements in certain specified branches.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-013-a" place="upper middle of the page"><figDesc>Ball High School, Galveston</figDesc></figure>

<p>The state has a permanent school fund, in cash, bonds and land notes, now amounting to about $25,000,000. There are also about 22,000,000 acres of land, worth perhaps a dollar per acre, set apart for the support of the schools. At present the schools receive between three and a half and four million dollars a year, part of this being interest on the bonds and land notes, and part being taxes set aside for school purposes. Cities and towns may have exclusive control of the public schools within their limits and may levy a special tax, not to exceed one half of one per cent, for additional support. Thus the total outlay for schools is really much greater than the sum named above.</p>

<p>The Sam Houston Normal Institute for the training of teachers is at Huntsville. It is well equipped with buildings and material. It has furnished the state with a large number of teachers and has done much to advance the cause of education. It was founded in 1879, and during the first twenty years there were nearly five thousand students enrolled.</p>


<p>The North Texas State Normal College is at Denton. The building and grounds were given by the people of  Denton. The school was opened the first year of the present century and already has a large attendance.</p>

<p>The Southwest Texas Normal School is located at San Marcos. The citizens of the town gave the land on which the school building has been erected.</p>

<p>Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College is near Hempstead, in Waller county. It has for its main object the education of colored teachers.</p>

<p>The Girl's Industrial College is at Denton. This town made a gift of the land and a sum of money towards founding the school.</p>

<p>The Agricultural and Mechanical College is in Brazos county, at College Station, five miles south of Bryan. This is a branch of the University of Texas, but is under a separate management. The purpose of the school is to teach the leading studies related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, as well as military tactics. The school is excellently equipped with buildings and apparatus.</p>

<p>The University of Texas is in Austin, but with a Medical Department in Galveston. The Main University includes the Departments of literature, Science and Arts, of Engineering, and of Law. It was opened  in 1883; the Medical Department was opened eight years later. The' University buildings and equipment are among the best in the South, and its high standing is everywhere recognized.</p>

<figure entity="txu-oclc-17540901-e-013-b" place="lower middle of the page"><figDesc>University of Texas, in Austin</figDesc></figure>


<p>In January, 1839, the Congress of the Republic gave fifty leagues of public land for the support of a University and set apart the ground for its campus in Austin. In 1858 the legislature of the state added $100,000 in United States bonds and also one section of land out of every ten reserved for the use of the state. Under the authority of the Constitution of 1876, the state took back these lands, except fifty leagues, and substituted for them 1,000,000 acres farther west. Later another million acres were added. Most of these lands are leased.</p>

<p>Like other state institutions, both the Agricultural and Mechanical College and the University receive grants from the legislature.</p>


<p><hi rend="bold">10. Government</hi></p>

<p>The government of Texas, like that of the other states of the Union, is divided into three departments, &mdash; legislative, executive and judicial.</p>

<p>The law-making or legislative department consists of a Senate and a House of Representatives, styled The Legislature of the State of Texas."</p>

<p>The Senate has thirty one members; one half (fifteen or sixteen, as the case may be) are elected every two years and serve four years.<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-e-013-1" n="1"></note>
 The members of the House of Representatives are elected biennially for two years. There cannot be more than one representative for every fifteen thousand inhabitants, and the total membership of the House cannot exceed one hundred and fifty. The present number, under the apportionment of 1901, is one hundred and thirty-three.</p>


<note id="txu-oclc-17540901-e-013-1" n="1">Following a reapportionment, a new Senate is elected and the members draw by lot for the long and the short terms (two and four years), after which, until the next reapportionment, they are elected as above described.</note>




 

<pb n="14" id="txu-oclc-17540901-e-014" rend="Arabic" place="upper left" />

<p>The Lieutenant Governor is <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> President of the Senate; that body elects a President <hi rend="italic">pro tempore</hi> to preside in the absence of the Lieutenant Governor. The presiding officer of the House of Representatives is the Speaker, who is elected by that body from its own membership.</p>

<p>The Legislature meets every two years at such time as may be provided by law (second Tuesday in January) and at other times when called by the Governor.</p>

<p>The executive department consists of the Governor, who is the chief executive officer of the state, a Lieutenant Governor, a Secretary of State, a Comptroller of Public Accounts, a Treasurer, a Commissioner of the General Land Office, and an Attorney-General. The Constitution provides for these officers. The Secretary of State is appointed by the Governor; the other officers here named are elected for a term of two years.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, the statutes provide for a State Superintendent of Public Instruction, elected for two years; a Commissioner of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics and History, appointed for two years by the Governor; three Railroad Commissioners, one elected every two years for a term of six years; also the State Health Officer, State Revenue Agent and various administrative boards.</p>

<p>The judicial department consists of the Supreme Court, with three judges, one of whom is elected every two years for a term of six years; the Court of Criminal Appeals, with three judges elected in the same manner; Courts of Civil Appeals, five in number, one for each district into which the state is divided, and with three judges for each court, elected like the judges above; District Courts, of which there are now sixty-three, with judges elected; for four years; County Courts, in organized counties, with judges elected for two years; Commissioners' Courts, in organized counties, presided over by the County Judge, and with four Commissioners elected for two years; Justices' Courts, of which there is one in each of the precincts (not less than four nor more than eight) into which the county is divided, and presided over by Justices of the Peace, elected biennially for two years.</p>

<p>Vacancies in the offices of the judges of the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeals, the Court of Civil Appeals and the District Courts are filled by appointment by the Governor, until the next general election. Vacancies in the office of County Judge and Justice of the Peace are filled by appointment by the Commissioners' Court, until the next general election for such offices.</p>


<p><hi rend="bold">11. Geology of Texas<note target="txu-oclc-17540901-e-014-1" n="1"></note></hi></p>

<p>There is a close relation between the underlying rocks of a country and its surface features, such as relief, soil, water supply, mineral resources and life. If we are to understand the physical geography of Texas we must know something of its rocks &mdash;we must study its <hi rend="italic">geology</hi>.</p>

<p>KINDS OF ROCKS
</p>
<p>Rocks may be classified in various ways. For our purpose they may be grouped into three divisions:</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">1. Sedimentary or stratified rocks.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">2. Igneous rocks.</hi></p>
 
<p><hi rend="italic">3. Altered or metamorphic rocks.</hi></p>

<p><hi rend="italic">l. Sedimentary rocks</hi> are those which have been formed in water&mdash;we usually say, deposited in water. They are made up of layers or <hi rend="italic">strata</hi> (singular <hi rend="italic">stratum</hi>) and for that reason are often called <hi rend="italic">stratified rocks</hi>.</p>

<p>Some sedimentary rocks have been formed by the wasting away and decay of older rocks. Such, for example, is <hi rend="italic">shale</hi>, which is hardened mud or silt, and <hi rend="italic">sandstone</hi>, which is composed of grains of a hard mineral called <hi rend="italic">quartz</hi>. Others have been formed from the shells and skeletons of sea and fresh-water animals, as oysters, clams and other mollusks, corals and the like. By the dashing of the waves along the shore they have been broken into fragments, or even ground to a pulp. From such materials <hi rend="italic">limestones </hi>have been formed.</p>

<p>Again, far out upon the surface of the sea there are found myriads of lowly animals, called, <hi rend="italic">foraminifers</hi>, living in minute shells. They die and their shells fall to the bottom where, mingled with other deep-sea deposits, they form <hi rend="italic">ooze</hi>. This is the first stage in the formation of a rock called <hi rend="italic">chalk</hi>, which is another kind of <hi rend="italic">limestone</hi>.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that water in which mineral matter is dissolved evaporates. When this takes place the mineral matter will be deposited in beds or strata. Beds of <hi rend="italic">rock salt</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gypsum </hi>have been formed in this way.</p>

<p>Of the rocks found in Texas, sedimentary rocks are by far the most abundant.</p>

<p>2. <hi rend="italic">Igneous rocks</hi> are those which have been formed by the cooling of melted mineral matter. Such rocks are common about volcanoes. Tlrey are also found at times filling cracks or fissures in the earth's crust. If they have been formed far below the surface, they are now seen only where the overlying rocks have been worn away.</p>

<p>As examples of igneous rocks mention may be made of <hi rend="italic">granite</hi> (the State Capitol at Austin is built of granite), <hi rend="italic">basalt</hi>, a dark volcanic rock which is cut by joints into many sided columns, <hi rend="italic">pumice</hi>,a hardened rock froth, and <hi rend="italic">lava </hi>of various kinds.</p>

<p>In Trans-Pecos Texas there are lava outpourings, on the Coastal plain a few widely separated outbreaks of basalt, and in Burnet and Llano counties outcrops of granite.</p>

<p>3. <hi rend="italic">Altered</hi> or <hi rend="italic">metamorphic rocks</hi> are either sedimentary or igneous rocks which have been changed by the action of heat. They have been baked under great pressure and in the presence of moisture. The effect of this varies with different rocks. Some are only hardened, others are changed in a chemical way, new minerals being formed by the rearrangement of the matter of which they are composed, and others still are altered in color and in their general appearance. These are some of the results of <hi rend="italic">metamorphism </hi>(change).</p>

<p>THE ROCKS OF TEXAS </p>
<p>
With the exception of a serea, known as the "Burnet Courntry" or "Central region," all of Texas east of the Staked plain bouderline by rocks of <hi rend="italic">marine</hi> origin, that is, by sits.  The Staked plains, however, are capped by or <hi rend="italic">lake</hi> deposits.</p>
<p>In the Trans-Pecos region tains and basins tere are found not only marine and non-marine deposits, but also igneous and altered rocks.

<p>Their distribution in Texas is shown on the accompanying geologic map. It will there be seen that they form, for the most part, a series of more or less parallel belts or

strips running in a northeast and southwest direction. Moreover, until the Staked plains are reached, each belt, beginning with that bordering the gulf of Mexico, is of a greater age than the preceding.</p>

<p>The rocks of the "Burnet Country," before mentioned, form an exception to this general statement.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Recent and Neocene Systems.</hi> The most recently formed rocks, those lying along the coast, are made up of sand, clay and silt. In them are found the remains of animals, chiefly shells, now living in the Gulf. This first belt, which, underlies the Coastal plain, is of the Recent and Neocene systems. On account of their great similarity they have not been separately indicated on the map.</p>

<p>It is well to remember, in this connection, that geologically speaking a rock need not be hard, but that any matter forming a part of the earth's crust is a rock, be it a mass of granite or a bed of sand or clay.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Eocene System.</hi> The outcropping beds of Eocene rocks form the second belt across the state. They are composed of sands, sandstones, clays of different colors, from white to black, thin-bedded limestones, etc. Beds of lignite, an inferior kind of coal, are often found.</p>

<p>The lignite beds are usually lens shaped &mdash;thick in the middle and thinning out towards the margin &mdash;and of limited extent, while coal seams may form continuous layers over a large area. In some instances the lignite beds have a thickness of twelve or more feet. Petrified wood and gypsum are also found in the Eocene formation, and in East Texas beds of workable iron ore. The presence of oil and natural gas should also be noted.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Cretaceous System.</hi> Further inland the outcropping Cretaceous rocks form a rather broad band stretching from the Red river to the Rio Grande. Viewed as a whole they are limestones, but there are also beds of sand, clay and shale. Some of the chalky beds contain the remains of foraminifers. Other limestones are composed of shells, either whole or in a fragmental state. In short, we find in the rocks of this system both deep-sea and shore deposits.</p>

<p>The Black and Grand prairies are underlain by Cretaceous limestones; Cretaceous sands are the reservoirs of a large artesian water supply; and an upper member of the system, the Taylor formation, is the source of the oil at Corsicana.</p>

<p>The rocks thus far studied have been termed the "Gulf Border Formations." They are inclined, or dip, gently to the south and east,&mdash;that is towards the sea,&mdash;as shown in the accompanying diagram. From this figure we can easily understand how it is possible for rock sheets or strata to outcrops in succession and to increase in age from the coast towards the interior, the order being Recent, Neocene, Eocene, Cretaceous.</p>

<p>Now a marked change occurs. The rocks belonging to the two systems following appear, for the greater part, in a basin lying between the Staked plains and the Grand prairie. (Consult both the geologic and the relief map).</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Carboniferous System.</hi> These rocks form the "buried floor" upon which the Cretaceous rocks were deposited. They consist of limestones, shales and sandstones, together with seams of coal, several of which are of value. Beds of clay are also found. The term "Coal Measures" is sometimes applied to these rocks. Carboniferous deposits are also known in the Guadalupe mountains and at other points in the Trans-Pesos country.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Permian System.</hi>  Beds of the Permian system follow those of the Carboniferous in the ascending order. They are exposed over a greater area in the same basin. Here are found clays, sands limestone and gypsum deposits. On account of their widespread red color they are usually spoken of as the Red Beds."</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Jura-trias System.</hi> Skirting the eastern scarp of the Staked plains there is a narrow band of nearly horizontal strata composed of sandstone and a coarse pebbly rock called conglomerate, together with clay. Its proper position is between the rocks of the Permian system and those of the Cretaceous. Generally speaking, however, it appears between the Permian rocks and the " Staked Plains Formations"	 to be described later, the Cretaceous rocks being absent.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">Ordovician and Cambrian Systems.</hi> Tire oldest stratified rocks found in Texas occour in two rather limited areas one near El Paso and other near the center of the state surrounding exposures of granites and schists. In the last-mentioned region the Ordovician rocks are in the form of thick, heavy limestones, while those of the Cambrian are chiefly sandstones alternating with limestones.</p>


<p><hi rend="bold">Archean System</hi>. Beneath the rocks of the Cambrian system there is a series of beds which have been named the "Llano Group". It consists of schists and other altered rocks which, with the granites, represent the Archean system.</p>

<p>Granite consists of quartz, feldspar and mica. Feldspar is often of a pinkish color, and it is this mineral which gives to the Capitol at Austin its peculiar tint. The quartz is sometimes glassy and transparent, or it may be of a milky white color. In the Capitol granite the thin scaly layers of mica are black.</p>

<p><hi rend="bold">The Staked Plains Formations</hi> have been classed as belonging to the Neocene and Recent systems, but unlike the rocks belonging to these systems before described as bordering the Gulf coast, they are lake deposits.</p>

<p>The rocks of time Neocene system consist of sands, clays of various colors, sandstone and limestone. The Recent deposits are found the surface and consist of silt, sand, gravel and sometimes bowlders.</p>

<p>Along the southeast border of the Staked plains the Neocene beds rest upon those of the  Cretaceous, but north of the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos river they rest upon the Jura-trias. Some of the strata afford fossils representing parts of the skeletons of such animals as the elephant, horse and camel.</p>
