Usage: $0 WIKITAG

This script creates a permuted article dump file from a raw (unpermuted)
Wikipedia dump (as downloaded from dumps.wikipedia.org). WIKITAG is
something like 'dewiki-20120225'.  The permuting is done so that the
articles can be split into training/dev/test subsets in the obvious way
without running into problems due to the non-random ordering of articles
in the original dump file.

This script is normally run by 'download-preprocess-wiki' and implements
the 'permute' step.

See README.preprocess and the comments in the source file for more details.
